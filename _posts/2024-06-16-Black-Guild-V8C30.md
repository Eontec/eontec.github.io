"Good day to all the special citizens of Orswood, the Land of the Holy Tree!　Today, the First Princess of Orswood, Lilithia Orpheun, will begin the broadcast!"

　Lilicia says cheerfully to the drone's camera, and the comments begin to flow briskly.

"Hello!」     
"I've been waiting for you.」      
"This is why I was born!」
"Me too!」    
"Hello!」      
"Hello!」       
"Princess!　I love you!」     
"My princess is so beautiful, it's hard to live today.」    
"Princess!　It's me!　Please make me a citizen!」      
"［¥100000］Here are today's taxes. Please pay it.」         
<!--more-->

"Wa, waa, thank you ...... everyone for all the comments today!　I will do my best to live up to your expectations!"

　Lilicia started her stream with a huff and a puff of energy.      
　As a princess, she must have had many opportunities to speak in public on the other side of the world, and she adapted to the streamer culture in no time.      
　I'm not sure I'm doing as well as I am now, but I'm very proud of myself.

"I've received a lot of letters today, so I'll read them. Let's see, 『Hello Princess, thank you very much for your delivery. I'm wondering about your diet in the other world, what kind of food did you usually eat?　I would be very happy if you could tell me. I will continue to support and be loyal to my beautiful princess』....... Thank you, my deepest gratitude for your loyalty."

　Lilicia smiled gently at the camera.       
　The way she smiled was as beautiful as a painting. Lilicia may have a pompous side, but it's this kind of thing that shows she's a true princess.

「My princess is too beautiful ......」      
「Huh?　An angel?」     
「My dirty heart has been cleansed ......」      
「I'm a fan of Shachiken, but I don't forgive him for stealing my princess's heart.」      
「The company animal stole something terrible from me.......」     
「I'd like to pledge my allegiance to you, and if I may, I'd like to lick the back of your hand.」      
「Officer, this is the guy.」      
「I can't wait to be a real citizen, not a special citizen.」      
「［¥400000］ Smile money.」       
「［¥650000］ I have to pay my taxes.」       
「I'm sure there are a lot of wealthy people in the princess's stream.」       
「［¥150000］...please tell me they're trained.」

　A storm of Super Chats.      
　I watch it on my phone and mutter, "Amazing......."

"It's long past 10 million subscribers, and I wonder if they're going to overtake my channel too."

　I whispered to myself as I looked at Lilicia, who was happily chatting in the distribution space in the corner of the room.       
　We were in the newly built White Wolf Guild. It was built on the grounds of the Ministry of Monster Control, and was just completed a few days ago.

　Lilicia has been pouring almost all of her free time into streaming since she arrived here.       
　That is not playing by any means. By doing so, she is increasing her fan base of allies and providing information about other worlds to an unspecified number of people for free.       
　In doing so, the risk of kidnapping her is no longer worth the return.      
There is always someone in this building, either me, Amatsuki, or Rin. If you can come, you can come.

"She's doing a great job, isn't she?"

　Saying this, Amatsuki sat down in the chair across from my desk.       
　She is usually busy working, but now that she had the job of escorting Lilicia, she was able to spend more and more time peacefully at the guild these days.         
　That naturally increased the amount of time we spent together, and I felt like I was living with her, which made me feel nervous.       
　I try my best to keep my cool and reply to her, trying not to show such feelings.

"Yes, that's true. I'm really proud of her. Suddenly thrown into a different world, and yet didn't even utter a whimper. We have to support her."

　Perhaps It was fate that I met her in the dungeon and saved her.
　I want to help as much as I can, including Dagosuke, who was sleeping on the first floor.

　
As I was thinking about this, I noticed Amatsuki looking at me and smiling in a funny way.

"What is it?　Is there something on my face?"     
"No, I just thought your like that hasn't changed since the old days."      
"What do you mean, that part of you?"      
"You're a good-for-nothing. Well, that's what I like about you."     
"What ......?"

　I froze at the sudden words.      
 Seeing me like that, Amatsuki smiled wickedly and said, “Hehe.” Gug...I've been beaten so badly. I'm disappointed, but there's nothing I can do. When I was wondering what was going on, 

"Well, that's the good thing about being a teacher." 

　Rin came to sit right next to me on the sofa with a thud.       She then put her hand on my arm and hugged me. As if to show Amatsuki what...... she wants.

'I'm going to help you too, not just my sister, so you can count on me as well."     
"Oh, ah. I'm counting on you, Rin."

　Saying that, Rin makes a smug " Mwah" face.     
　Rin also spends most of her time at this office now. Recently, she has been bringing in a lot of personal belongings and has completely become a resident. The skill with which she does it is frightening.

"I'll do my best!　Lilicia is my friend!"


　Hoshino sat down next to me.        
　She is also a member of the White Wolf White Wolf Guild and lives in the office. I wondered if I could keep her, who is still a college student, but her mother, Junsumi, seemed to have sent her off with a good heart. I wondered why.

　Well, she is very close to Lilicia in age, and they get along well. Her presence brightens up the atmosphere of the office, and to be honest, it's a big help.

"Ah!　What are you all doing here?　Won't you join us?"

　Lilicia noticed that we were gathered and came over to me and for some reason sat on my lap. Amatsuki saw this and raised an eyebrow. Oh no, she looks angry.(Tl: Is it just me, or is this Amatsuki V. Everyone? Amatsuki solos tho)

"Oh, hey, Lilicia, why don't you get off for a while?　Look, you're on stream too."      
"Hmm?　It's fine. My people's leaders are not so narrow-minded as to be offended by this!"

「Yes, they are (with tears of blood).」       
「Shachiken...... remember me, .......」     
「You tasted the princess's ass (snaps).」      
「You've got Rin and Yui. They smell so good.」     
「I'm still in the harem office.」      
「Kanade is there too!　Step on it!」      
「I really envy you. I want to sit on Tanaka's lap too.」        
「Please release Shachiken ASMR soon.」     
「You Shachiken fans can't waver, can you?」(Tl: Literal degenerates, that's what they are)

　The comments flowed at a blistering pace.      
　Some of them are clearly angry. Ugh, my stomach hurts. ......

"Oh, yes, Tanaka!　I've come up with a great way to fit in over here!　The people's leaders are listening, so do you mind if I tell them now?"     
"Hmm?　What is it?"

　I asked back without knowing why.       
　Then Lilicia dropped a bombshell.

"If only Warawa and Tanaka would get married...!　Then I would be a part of this world. What do you think?"      
"Hee...........?　Eeeeeeeeee?"(Tl: Lilicia making big moves lol, Amatsuki in shambles)

　Not only me, but also Amatsuki and the others were surprised and shouted loudly.        
　Naturally, the comment section was also screaming. Even I couldn't keep track of the volume of posts.

"huh?　huh?　What's going on?"

　Among them, Lilicia was the only one who was staring blankly.         
　I'm going to be in a lot of trouble again.
