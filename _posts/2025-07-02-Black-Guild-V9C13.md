『GIIIIII!!』       
『GYOOOOOO!!』

As we charged into the horde of Fish-men, they attacked us, letting out high-pitched shrieks.       
Looking at them, Dagosuke's face kept flashing in my mind. No, their faces aren't that similar, but their overall appearance at first glance is quite alike…        
I feel a little guilty, but they're just normal monsters. I'll deal with them as usual.

「Fish-men are scary」       
「They look pretty strong」       
「I think they're A-rank monsters, right? They're normally strong」       
「Dozens of A-rank monsters, that's despair-level normally lol」       
「My old self would have panicked」         
「Indeed lol」         
「First-timer here. Why is everyone so calm when there are so many monsters!? It's dangerous!」        
「Eh, there's still a first-timer?」       
「Japanese first-timers... I thought they were extinct<!--more-->」          
「A precious first-timer! Surround them!」          
「Gently lead them into the swamp! Don't scare them right away!」          
「Teamwork is excellent lol」

Fish-men are skilled in underwater combat, and they don't use any particularly special attacks on land.         
However, their musculature is highly developed, to the point where they can defeat a Minotaur with their bare hands despite not being that large. Moreover, their scales are hard enough to deflect ordinary blades, and the fins on their arms boast considerable sharpness.                
They are opponents that even experienced explorers need to be careful of.

『SHAAA!!』

A Fish-man approached me and immediately slashed at me with its fin.             
So I firmly caught its fin with my right hand.

"As expected, compared to Dagosuke's fin, the sharpness is quite a bit lower. So they're similar but completely different species, huh?"

『Jya...?』

「Fish-man-kun is confused lol」         
「Reminds me of the Dagosuke fight lol」        
「Eh!? Why is this person stopping a monster's attack with his bare hands!?」         
「First-timer-kun is so fresh and cute」         
「Answer: Because he's Shachiken」       
「Every single one of Shachiken's actions surprises me, if only I had that...」

I observed it closely, and it seems this Fish-man is indeed a normal monster. In that case, there's no need to hold back. Let's defeat it quickly and move on.          

"Hmph!"

『GYOAH!?』

I punched the Fish-man in the abdomen.          
The Fish-man let out a pained cry and bent its body into a V-shape. It managed to stay standing for a few seconds, but then collapsed to the ground. Its toughness is leagues apart from Dagosuke, who could withstand several hits.

「Eh, he punched it and it fell... Is this really not CGI?」          
「It's not CGI, you know」         
「Tanaka is more monstrous than the monsters themselves lol」       
「First-timer-kun's reaction is 100 points」         
「《Dagosuke》"Big Bro's punches hurt, you know... Just remembering it gives me chills"」        
「Dagosuke's here lol」      
「Why are you watching too!?」
「Well, he's staying home, so it's fine for him to watch lol」         
「Those with experience speak」

『GIIII...』           
『GYAA!!』

Perhaps angered by their comrade being defeated, the other Fish-men all leaped at me at once.

「Whoa!! So many attacking! Run!」        
「First-timer-kun really has good reactions lol」       
「First-timer-kun is too cute」         
「Well, just watch (arms crossed, boyfriend-like expression from behind)」          
「The one who needs to run is the Fish-man-kun, you know」       
「《Dagosuke》You can say that again lol」       
「Why is this Fish-man commenting normally?」         
「His adaptability is too high」        
「He's better at using the internet than my mom lol」

Besides their fins, Fish-men also have sharp claws and fangs as weapons. They bared them and tried to stab me. Attacks of this level are fine even without defense, but it would be troublesome if my suit got scratched. I'll deal with them quickly.        
I put my hand on the sword at my waist and swung it at high speed.       

"Tachibana Style Swordsmanship, Flash!"

In a flash, a sword gleam streaked, deeply cutting through the bodies of the approaching Fish-men.            
There were a total of ten sword gleams. The old me was bad at this delicate technique, but now I can handle it at the same level as my master, Tachibana-san... or so I believe.

「EHHHHHHHHHH!? What happened!? He defeated everyone in an instant! Amazing!」         
「First-timer-kun is super excited lol」        
「I really couldn't see it lol I can't even tell frame by frame lol」        
「The Fish-men probably didn't know what happened either」        
「Shachiken-san is that amazing! I've become a fan!」       
「And so, another person falls into the Tanaka swamp」       
「This swamp is good. It's comfortable and deep」        
「Swamp? I don't understand, but I'll keep watching the stream!」       
「If new viewers like this keep coming, the channel's future is bright」

Having defeated the Fish-men, I sheathed my sword and shifted my gaze towards Dojima-san and the others. Neither of them seemed to have struggled with mere Fish-men, and their combat was also about to end.           
Well, it's a long way ahead.             
Let's hurry to the deepest part of the dungeon.
