"I see, I see! So this is a different world from the one I was in, and this is inside a dungeon located on the seabed of your world! I understand everything now!"

Dr. Nero, who came from another world, reacted like that after hearing my explanation.      
What an easy person to explain things to... Well, perhaps Dagosuke and Lilicia, the otherworlders I've met so far, were just special cases.

「Super fast understanding lol」      
「Another weird person has joined the party」      
「But it's just... I don't know. Compared to the previous two, he's normal lol」      
「Of course, after a fish-man and an elf, a human would feel that way」      
「I think he's sufficiently eccentric, but the previous ones were just too intense... lol」      
「It's wrong to compare them lol」      
「My Princess~」      
「《Lilicia》"Hey! You're making fun of me! That's disrespectful, disrespectful!"」      
「Princess!?」      
「The Princess is watching too」      
「Princess under surveillance」

The comment section was also lively. I thought it was because a new otherworlder had arrived, but looking closely, it seems it's lively because Lilicia is commenting. What is she doing?       
Well, leaving the lazy princess at home, let's focus on this doctor for now.<!--more-->      
Otherworlders are important beings; we must deliver them safely to the surface no matter what. In some cases, it might even be necessary to cut short the dungeon exploration.      
I need to listen carefully to his story to decide on future actions.      
By the way, Dojima-san was watching our exchange nearby. I thought he could handle the questioning, but he left it to me, saying, "You're more used to dealing with otherworlders, aren't you?"      
It's frustrating that I can't talk back.

"Um, are you sure it's okay to believe so easily? I'll answer if you have any concerns."      
"There's no need for that. I already knew that this place was on a different dimensional axis from my world. I'm already grasping the structure of this dungeon, and it's probably true that it's on the seabed."

Dr. Nero said, then took out a crystal-like object from his pocket.       
And as he infused it with magic energy, an image floated in the air. Is this... a hologram? I heard from Lilicia that other worlds have advanced magic technology instead of scientific technology, but they even have this kind of technology?      
The displayed image was a three-dimensional map of the dungeon. A red glowing circle was slightly below the center. This was probably where we were. It seems the magic technology of other worlds is much more advanced than I had imagined if they can create something like this.      
Mr. Maki, the research fanatic, would surely have been excited if he saw this.

"I was researching dimensional magic in my original world. I was investigating where the 'drifters' from other worlds that occasionally came to this world originated from. In the process, I found a dimensional hole, but... I got so engrossed in my research that I fell into the hole. And before I knew it, I was inside this dungeon. It's a good thing I carried several magic tools with me."      
"I see..."

And then he was eaten by the Kraken, leading to the present situation.      
Dagosuke and Lilicia came to this world by someone's hand, but this person seems to have come here by accident.      
Still, to be sent to a dungeon on the seabed like this, he's quite unlucky. If we hadn't happened to come along, escaping would have been hopeless.      

"So, you were unharmed despite being eaten by the Kraken, thanks to that magic tool?"      
"Yes. I'm covered in a defensive barrier around my body by the power of the magic tools I created. Unfortunately, I don't have a talent for combat. I barely survived by making full use of several magic tools."

I feel a strange unfathomable depth from this person named Nero, but I don't sense the aura unique to strong individuals. It's probably not a lie that he has no talent for combat.      
...Well, I think I've asked everything I needed to for now.      
As expected, this person is important. We need to send him safely to the surface. I looked at Dojima-san to ask for his judgment.    

"What should we do? Should we return to the surface for now?"      
"Indeed. Fortunately, a monster disaster hasn't occurred yet. We might have enough time to go back once."

Dojima-san agreed with my words.
Then Dr. Nero reacted with an "Hmm?"

"What is this 'monster disaster' you speak of?"      
"A monster disaster is when monsters from inside a dungeon come out. It happens occasionally in this world."      
"Ah, you mean a 'Dungeon Break.' I see, I see... If you're concerned about that, it might be better to help me later."      
"What do you mean?"      
"I mean that the 'monster disaster' you are concerned about will occur soon."      
"What did you say...!?"

Rin reacted with a loud voice after hearing Dr. Nero's words and pressed him.      
Her face was pale, and sweat beaded on her forehead. She seemed quite agitated. I need to calm her down first.
