"Phew, I think we're safe now."     
     
　We quickly left the zoo and had made our way back to the station.     
　We stopped the stream and left immediately, but we saw a few people looking for us on the way to the station.     
　That was close. The perception obstruction isn't perfect, so if people actively search like that, there's a chance we could be found.     
　If one person finds us and draws attention, others might notice too. It looks like we need to get to a different location quickly.     
     
"We ran quite a bit, are you okay?"     
"Heh heh... Yes, I'm fine."     
     
　Lilicia let out an amused laugh when I asked.     
　I wonder what's wrong. I tilted my head.     
     
"Did you see them, Tanaka? Those people were looking for us. Ah, that was close, I'm still a little excited."<!--more-->     
     
　It seemed that the act of sneaking around and escaping together really hit her sweet spot.     
　I don't quite get it, but if she enjoyed herself, then it's fine.     
     
"Was it that fun?"     
"Yes... it is fun. When I was in my homeland, the Holy Tree Kingdom, I never got to play outside like this or hide and run away from anyone."     
     
　Lilicia is the princess of the Elven Kingdom.     
　I don't know what life is like for an elven princess, but I doubt she had much freedom of movement. She had to fight the Demon King alongside her comrades; the princess's responsibilities must have been heavy.     
　She suddenly came to this world and has been having a tough time. I'd be happy if she could at least enjoy herself right now.     
　If it's for that, then having a ruckus from a stream and having to write dozens of apology reports is a small price to pay.     
　I'm used to writing apology reports from my corporate slave life. I could write them in my sleep.     
     
"Alright, then let's head to the next spot."     
"Mm! I'm looking forward to it!"     
     
　And so, I resumed my Tokyo sightseeing with her, as she happily wiggled her long ears.     
     
     
◇　◇　◇     
     
     
　After leaving the zoo and getting back on the train, we toured various famous spots in Tokyo.     
　We visited Tokyo's symbolic red tower and the charming old downtown areas. In Shibuya and Harajuku, we struggled through the crowds but still managed to see the sights and eat delicious food and sweets.     
　Every time we visited a new place, Lilicia laughed so joyfully and enjoyed herself wholeheartedly.     
　At first, I thought a date would be a lot of trouble, but seeing her enjoy it so much made me glad I brought her out.     
     
"Tanaka! Where are we going next?! I don't think we can skip this exquisite fluffy pancake, for one!"     
"Next... you've got a lot of energy, aren't you tired?"     
     
　Today we've been walking almost non-stop. We haven't stayed in one place for long, so we've been moving around a lot.     
　This is more tiring than a poor dungeon exploration.     
     
"How pathetic, Tanaka. I can still keep going!"     
"Is this youth... it's blinding."     
"You're not that old yourself!"     
     
　Lilicia gave me a sharp retort.     
　I appreciate her saying that, but my soul has aged after a long corporate slave life. I often think how young Hoshino and Rin are when I see them.     
　It's not that I don't want to go home and sleep, but I can't look pathetic now. I should try to look cool, at least on a rare outing like this.     
     
"Alright. Then let's go eat those whatever-you-call-them pancakes."     
"As expected of Tanaka, you understand! Alright, let's go together!"     
     
　Lilicia linked her arm through mine and started walking happily.     
　I feel like we closed a lot of distance today. She's always shown affection, but it feels like that affection has grown and now she isn't hiding it at all.     
     
"Good, if I take it like this... Yes! I got a great shot!"     
     
<div data-nat="424166"></div>

　Lilicia occasionally took photos and posted them on SNS.     
　Since many fans wanted to see the date, I gave her permission to upload photos. Live streaming is definitely out, but photos shouldn't get us found.     
　I haven't checked, but SNS seems to be quite lively. Fans are making pilgrimages to the shops Lilicia visited, and they seem to be booming. I hear many shops are sending her messages, asking her to visit. She's a high-economic-impact princess.     
     
"Hey Tanaka, what should we do next? When night falls, I want to see the 'illumination,' too... Hm?"     
     
　Lilicia, who had been speaking cheerfully, suddenly looked up and made a puzzled sound.     
　I followed her gaze and looked up, only to see something large falling from above... it crashed into the ground with a loud sound.     
     
"...!?"     
"W-What is it!?"     
     
　A shockwave ran through the area, and dust flew up.     
　I instantly stepped in front of Lilicia to protect her.     
　Fortunately, nothing too big flew at us, and neither Lilicia nor the surrounding pedestrians seemed to be injured.     
　But what fell from above... was something incredible.     
     
『Grrr...』     
「Gya gya gya!」     
     
　A wolf with grey fur, and a small, green-skinned goblin.     
　I've seen them many times, so there's no mistake. Those are a Grey Wolf and a Goblin.     
　Impossible. Why are monsters on the surface...!?
