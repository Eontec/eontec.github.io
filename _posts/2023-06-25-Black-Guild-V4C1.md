Tl: Sam

…

　It was a beautiful sunny Sunday.


　I was visiting the site of the former Sky Tree.

　The white radio tower that once represented Tokyo no longer exists in Tokyo.


　The Sky Tree disappeared as if sucked into the ground at the same time the dungeon was born.     
<!--more-->
　Incidentally, the Sky Tree is not the only one that has disappeared.


　So the Sky Tree has given up its role to its predecessor, the Tokyo Tower. There is talk of building a new radio tower, but the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is hesitant to do so because there is a strong possibility that the big structure will disappear again.


　If it disappears again, a large amount of taxpayers' money will be blown away. It is not unreasonable.


"But where did it disappear to?"


　As I stood there, remembering the white tower in my memory, I saw a figure running toward me.


"Excuse me. Sorry to keep you waiting, Sensei."


　The one who bowed with such a bow was my student, Rin.

　She was not dressed in her usual uniform, but in a cute plain outfit. I had never seen her in private before, so it was very fresh. To be honest, I was a little nervous.


"I just got here too, so don't worry about it. I'm more interested in your clothes. You look good in them."

"Really?　I don't have a lot of clothes that I can show you, so I was a little nervous about it,......, but I'm glad."


　Rin smiled happily.

　Even though she is like that, her gaze moved to the side and found someone a little behind me, and her gaze became a little sharper.


"I'd like to introduce you to a colleague of mine, Hoshino Yui."

"Yo, nice to meet you. ......."


　Hoshino steps forward with an apologetic look on her face.

By the way, I had sent a message to Hoshino in advance that Rin was coming. It was unusual for Hoshino to take so long to reply.


"I know her well from ....... She was on your stream."

"I see. Well, that's a quick story. I let the two of you meet because you're both the same age and awakened, and I thought you two would get along well. Look, isn't it better than being alone with someone like me?"


　When I said that, Hoshino and Rin sighed at exactly the same time "Haaaa"

　What is it? Did I possibly do something wrong?


"Well, I didn't expect that ...... Sensei would come that way. It's going to be a tough road ahead, isn't it?"

"Haha. I was surprised too. I'm sure you are too, aren't you, Ayakawa-san......?　It's tough on both of us, isn't it?"

"Isn't it true for you too, Hoshino-san? That means we're love rivals, right?"

"Hmmm, that's true.


　Hoshino laughs happily.


"It's true that we are love rivals, but I'd be happy if we could become good friends."

"I understand. We are love rivals and also friends. It would be good to get to know each other better. Nice meeting you, Hoshino-san."

"Yup♪"


　The two talked happily and then shook hands.

　I have no idea what they are talking about. Is it a current fad among girls?


"Sensei. What are your plans for today?"

"Ah I'm going to the arms shop today. I want to take care of my sword and strengthen Hoshino's sword."


　The materials from the "mount dragon" that was killed the other day are still in my bag.

　I'm planning to use it to strengthen my weapon today.


"Well, it'd be boring if we only did that, so let's get something to eat. I'll pay for it, of course."

"Really?　Thank you!"


　Hoshino bites into it with a twinkle in her eye.

　If she's happy, it's worth making my thin wallet even thinner.


　Since the money earned from the stream has not yet been deposited, the money to be used today will come from my meager savings from my days as a company employee. I wish I had taken some money from Adachi.


"Um, There is a famous cafe near here, and I want to have a parfait there. Is that okay?"

"Oh, of course. It would be great if you could tell me about such a place. Is it okay for Rin to go with us? Tell me if you don't like sweets"

"Well, I like sweets too. ......"

"Okay, Then it's decided, let's go there."


　After deciding where to go, we started walking while having small talk


...


Tl Note: Unexpected meeting of two harem members, and they seem to not have a bad dynamic. Still on with Amatsuki supremacy though, them man-stealers need to know their place, plus she's definitely the strongest of the three, and most influential.
