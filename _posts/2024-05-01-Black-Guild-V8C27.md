“...... I'm amazed. I thought I moved quickly.”

　Isosumi muttered as he looked at Amatsuki.    
　My feet were frozen to a crisp because of Amatsuki's magic, and it was a good feeling.

　But Isosumi did have a point.     
　Amatsuki must have had work today and could not come. Even if she did come to help us, it would be too early.

　Amatsuki came to our side and turned to Isosumi and the others.

"Minister Dojima had anticipated this turn of events as soon as Makoto made contact with the fisherman. An intelligent life form from another world, its value is immeasurable ...... and there would surely be interference.”

　What a surprise. So Dojima-san was moving before he met Lilicia? That would explain why Amatsuki got there in time. The fact that he had anticipated this much when he saw Dagosuke, that person is dependable.

“It is inconceivable that Makoto would be defeated by someone who is going to interfere with him, but it is possible that they could take advantage of him...... for example, to take hostages. In that case, the good-natured Makoto would be at a disadvantage. That’s why I came.” 

　It is true that it would have been bad if they used hostages.    
　It would be better to train and become fast enough to save up to three people.

"I have been entrusted by Minister Dojima with full authority over this situation. If you ignore his advice and continue to antagonize Makoto Tanaka and the two other worldlings, you will be considered an enemy of the Ministry of Evil Countermeasures. If you still insist on doing so, then ......”

　Amatsuki pulled out the blade of her sword and thrust the tip into the ground. Then the ground froze with a cracking sound!　

"Kanade Amatsuki, chief of the Ministry of Monster Control's First Assault Division, will be your opponent. How would you like to proceed?”

　Amatsuki said, glaring at her opponent.     
　He's too handsome. If I were a woman, I would have fallen in love with him for sure.

"I'm sure you understand who we are, don't you?　The Ministry of Monster Control is not that valuable to those otherworldly people. I don't think it's wise to antagonize them with trivial chivalry.”     
“I received a message from Minister Dojima saying, 'Come here a day before' The Ministry of Monster Control will be responsible for the custody of the two individuals. We will share the information we have obtained with the government without concealment. If you understand, then go home.”

　As Amatsuki said this, the ice covering their feet instantly melted.     
　However, they did not let their guard down yet, and their bodies are still releasing strong magical elements. It seemed as if they would be able to release the magic they had just used right away.

　The released men readjusted their weapons again and glared at Amatsuki.
　After being treated like that, that must have made them angry. But their leader, Isosumi, is not,

“All right, let's pull out for today."

　Amatsuki's request was readily accepted.    
　I wonder if there's something behind this.　As I was wondering if there was something fishy going on, Isosumi seemed to have sensed my feelings,

"If we continue to fight, we will unnecessarily consume the nation's war potential. That is not what we want."

　Hmmm, that is indeed true.     
　If the Ministry of Monster Control is damaged, it will create an opening for foreign invasions. That would be a blow to them as well. There is no profit in antagonizing them.      

"So, for the time being, I'll leave those two to you ・・・・. If we are unable to protect them, we will come back to you for custody."      
“That will not happen, so rest assured that you will be able to leave."     
"I pray so, .......” 

　Isosumi turned to me one last time and bowed, then left with his men.     
　Silence returned to the dungeon. I breathe a sigh of relief.

Thank you, Amatsuki, for saving my life.
I did what I had to do. I'm sorry for all the trouble you've been going through because of the government. I am sorry.

　Amatsuki lowered her eyebrows apologetically.
　It is not Amatsuki's fault. She is a very disciplined person. You don't have to worry about it.

　Oh, that's right. Are Dago and Lilithia safe?　I wondered if they had been kidnapped when I took my eyes off them.       
　I turned around to check, just as they were about to jump on me.

“Arigato bros~!　I'll never forget what you did for me!"     
"Hey, you're in my way!　You're in my way, Dagosuke!　This is where I'm supposed to hug you!”     

　I didn't need to worry, they were both in high spirits.      
　I'm so relieved.

"I've got a car outside. I'll take you two into custody, but I need you to come to the Ministry of Magic."     
"Oh, okay."

　I replied to Amatsuki.      
　I noticed that I could hear the sound of vibrations coming from behind me. It seems we don't have much time before the dungeon runs out.

　I took the two hugging me with me and we escaped from this dungeon.
