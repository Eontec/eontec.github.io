"Phew, what a great haul."

Successfully completing my dungeon fishing, I emerged from the water.      
Immediately, Rin approached me.

"Sensei! Are you alright?"      
"Yeah. More importantly, look, I caught a lot."

I threw the harvested prey onto the ground.      
A Sea Serpent, a sea monster, and a Kraken. Both are rare and taste good. I'm glad I found such good prey.

"Prey...? This is a Kraken, isn't it! A monster with high combat power even among S-ranks, and few sightings... To defeat it alone..."

「Oh, is she put off?」      
「Even Rin-chan is on that level of being put off, huh?」      
「Well, if he took that down in such a short time...」      
「Divorce crisis, lol」      
「No, wait a minute」 

"How strong he is... As expected of Sensei<!--more-->... ♡"

「Thud (sound of falling)」      
「She's fallen in love again, lol」      
「I knew it」       
「The wife of a musclehead is also a musclehead, lol」       
「I saw in an interview that Rin-chan fell in love with Shachiken after he completely defeated an octopus, so of course she likes his strength」        
「I'm done with this couple」       
「Explode forever」       
「Your eyes are heart-shaped」

I felt a wave of affection from Rin. It seems I managed not to disappoint her.      
It was worth diving in to catch them.

"Hey Tanaka! It's unfair to dive in and catch them when we were having a fishing contest!"      

Dojima-san, who had been fishing until now, approached and protested.      
Well, it's true that it might have been childish, even if it was just to look good for Rin. However, if I admit it, he'll probably get noisy again. I'll try to dodge it.

"I don't recall agreeing to a fishing contest. More importantly, come on, time is precious, so let's cook. Please help me."      
"Ah, hey! The conversation isn't over yet!"      
"Now, now. Dojima-san, please cut the Kraken's legs into easy-to-eat pieces."       
"Why do I have to do something like that...?"      
"That's a shame, I thought Dojima-san was the only one who could skillfully cut the Kraken's slimy legs..."      
"...Hmm, was that so? Hmph, then it can't be helped. I'll slice this up easily!"

Dojima-san said, then deftly sliced the Kraken with a knife.      
Quite skillful handling. It was the right decision to leave it to him.

「The Minister is too easy to manipulate lol」      
「This old man is too tsundere」      
「His knife skills are professional level lol」      
「He's being used well...」      
「The Minister also seems to enjoy cooking, so it's a win-win, right?」      
「Is Japan okay with someone so easily manipulated? Lol」       
「Well, Minister Dojima isn't easy to manipulate with people he doesn't like, so it's fine, right?」    

Since Dojima-san had prepped the Kraken, I also began my work.      
First, I filleted the Sea Serpent, removed its bones and fins. Then, I cut it into easy-to-eat pieces, skewered them, and applied my homemade sauce.    

"Alright, Rin, can you grill these?"      
"Yes, leave it to me."

Rin, who received them from me, began charcoal-grilling them on the grill.      
I recall she wasn't very good at cooking in the past, but her technique has improved. I heard she's been learning to cook from Hoshino at home, so that must be why.      
I need to thank Hoshino.

「Oh... looks delicious」      
「I'm getting hungry lol」      
「Sea Serpent-kun probably never imagined he'd be coated in sauce and charcoal-grilled, huh?」      
「How will they eat the Kraken? And what does it taste like?」      
「Visually, it probably tastes like octopus, right? I don't know though」      
「Eh, is this person really going to eat monsters? Unbelievable...」      
「First-timer-kun is also confused. Well, he'll probably get used to it by the end of this stream」       
「I remember those days... nostalgic」      
「He's acting like a veteran, but Shachiken only started streaming less than half a year ago, huh?」       
「Too many things have happened, it feels like I've been a fan for five years lol」      
「The content is too dense, so it can't be helped」

Leaving Rin to grill the Sea Serpent, I began preparing the next dish.      
I dissolved the powder I brought in water, added a Cockatrice egg, and mixed it further to create a batter. Then, I poured it onto a round griddle.      

"Dojima-san, can I get the small cut pieces?"      
"Hmm. Is this enough?"      
"Thank you."

I put the Kraken pieces into the batter and grilled them further.      
Once cooked, I flipped the batter and grilled it again. After it was crispy, I took it out, added sauce and mayonnaise, and it was complete.      
Seeing it, Rin asked in surprise.

"Sensei, this is...?"          
"Ah, it's 'Kraken Takoyaki.' This is delicious."
