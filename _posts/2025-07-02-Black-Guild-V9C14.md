Tl: Sam


…



After successfully driving away the Fish-men, we proceeded deeper into the dungeon.        
There were some flooded sections here and there, but it was helpful that we could advance without having to go through the water.        
It's a hassle to change clothes every time, after all.        
However, in return, many monsters appeared.         
A variety of monsters attacked us: Kelpies, horses with fish lower bodies; Gigafrogs, giant frogs large enough to swallow a person whole; and aggressive clams that attacked by spraying water, Bakemaguri.            
But there were three of us. No matter how many A-rank monsters appeared, we wouldn't struggle.         

"Hmph!"

As Dojima-san swung his fist down, the shell of a Bakemaguri was pulverized. Normally, <!--more-->the theory is to insert a blade into the gap of the shell and cut the adductor muscle, but for him, that didn't seem to matter.

"Is that all already!? How unsatisfying!"          
"You're going too fast, Dojima-san. You need to be careful with your stamina."         
"Hmph, with opponents of this level, I wouldn't run out of breath even if I fought them for three days and three nights!"

Dojima-san said, laughing in a good mood. He really is an energetic old man.

「He's so energetic lol」       
「He's more lively than in the Diet lol」(Tl: Who remembers the congress meeting from before?)      
「He's definitely a field type」         
「By the way, if he streams how strong he is, other politicians must be terrified lol」         
「They won't be able to heckle him anymore, huh?」          
「Our country's Minister can't possibly be this strong」          
「What light novel is that from?」         
「Dojima-san is crazy, but Tanaka not even breaking a sweat after fighting so much is also crazy. How many A-ranks has he defeated?」         
「We already know Tanaka is a monster, after all」         
「Rin-chan must have a tough time keeping up with these two」

I looked away from Dojima-san and at Rin.         
She was trying to maintain her composure, but she looked a little tired. Well, that's understandable; we've been moving for three hours since we entered this dungeon.        
Even Rin, who is accustomed to combat, would naturally get tired.

"The magic energy is getting denser, too, so let's take a break once we reach an open area. Once we've recovered, we'll head straight to the innermost part."          
"I can still go on, but... alright. I'm getting hungry anyway."

Good, a short break should revive Rin.        
I'll make some nutritious food.

"Can you push a little longer, Rin?"         
"Yes... Thank you for your consideration, Sensei."

Rin said, then walked closely beside me. I'm happy that she looks up to me, but it's a little embarrassing to have this scene streamed.

「They're flirting!」        
「Rin-chan is so cute when she's spoiled」       
「Riajuu explode!」       
「Tanaka: "Did I do something?"」       
「The explosion didn't work lol」       
「Damn it... I can't win against this」         
「I can eat five bowls of white rice just looking at Rin-chan's spoiled face」        
「Huh? I ate 8 times with Shachiken's swimsuit?」           
「What are they competing about...?」          
「This internet is full of perverts, huh?」           
「White rice? Swimsuit? What does that mean...? I don't understand, but the stream is interesting!」          
「First-timer-kun is the only solace...」



◇　◇　◇


After walking for about twenty more minutes, we reached an open area.            
There was no sign of monsters on the ground. It should be relatively safe here.

"Shall we take a break here?"           
"Hmm. Doesn't seem bad."

Since Dojima-san also agreed, I took out chairs and a table from my business bag and set them up. Then I took out the stove, cutting board, and cooking utensils...

"Hmm? Are you going to cook? I have portable rations, you know?"

As I was preparing, Dojima-san asked.        
He held a rectangular portable ration in his hand.        

"That's fine, but since we're here, I'll make something. It'll give us more energy."           
"Hmm, that's an interesting idea. I was curious about your cooking anyway."           
"Then Dojima-san, this too."

I took a long rod from my business bag and handed it to Dojima-san.            
Dojima-san took it and tilted his head.

"Hey Tanaka, this is...?"         
"Yes, it's a fishing rod."

Dungeon meals are basically sourced locally.          
Let's use this to get our lunch.
