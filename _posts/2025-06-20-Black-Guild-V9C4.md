"I am truly sorry about this matter!!"

Dojima-san said loudly and bowed deeply to me.     
This was the Minister's Office of the Ministry of Monster Control.     
In other words, Dojima-san's office.    
There, Dojima-san and I were sitting facing each other across a small table.    
The day after the news broke about Suda's escape, I was summoned here. Of course, I was called regarding Suda's escape.    
Dojima-san seemed to feel responsible for the matter and apologized as soon as we sat down.   
<!--more-->

"Please stop, Dojima-san. The Ministry of Monster Control isn't at fault for this, are they?"      
"Indeed, the escort was led by the Metropolitan Police Department. No one from our Ministry of Monster Control was at that scene. However... that doesn't mean I have no responsibility. We, the Ministry of Monster Control, once took custody of that man. We also bear responsibility."

Dojima-san said with a serious face.     
He was as honorable as ever.
But it was true that the news outlets were heavily blaming the Ministry of Monster Control. While Dojima-san had many supporters, he also had many enemies. Many were quick to criticize and find fault.      
Many people probably hoped to see him fall from grace. If Dojima-san were gone, this country's power would plummet. It would be convenient for foreign countries, I suppose. I can sympathize with his hardships.      

"Currently, the Metropolitan Police Department and the Ministry of Monster Control are jointly searching for Suda. I apologize, but I'd like you to wait a little longer. We will definitely find him, throw him in the slammer, and make him eat rotten food."      
"Yes, please do."

Suda's escape was an act that sullied the reputation of two organizations: the Metropolitan Police Department and the Ministry of Monster Control.      
Both organizations would seriously search for him to protect their prestige. I didn't think he'd be able to escape.

"But still, if it's Suda who escaped, isn't it only a matter of time before he's caught? He's an Awakened, but he hasn't been in a dungeon for a while, so I don't think he's that much of a threat."       
"I don't consider Suda himself to be that much of a threat. The problem is his accomplice."

The news had said that the escort vehicle was attacked by unknown assailants, and Suda escaped then.     
That attacker must be the accomplice.      
"The escort vehicle had personnel sent by the National Police Agency. All of them were skilled Awakened individuals. However, I heard they were neutralized in an instant. Rather, we are more concerned about that person. Of course, we are trying to capture Suda, but we are also tracking the whereabouts and identity of that mysterious individual."     
"A mysterious individual...?"     

Indeed, I'm more curious about that person's identity too.

"Why would such a skilled person help Suda escape? The Black Dog Guild is gone, and I don't think he has any use anymore."     
"Ah, about that... while investigating the flow of funds from the Black Dog Guild, we discovered something. That man had been offering the money earned by his employees, primarily you, to so-called 'underworld organizations'."     
"Underworld organizations...? Like something out of a manga..."

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

I was perplexed by the sudden appearance of that term.     
If that was true, then it truly was a black company to its core.

"We've identified a few organizations where he funneled funds. But all the ones we found were minor players. The organization to which he funneled the most money, we still haven't been able to grasp its tail."     
"And that organization helped Suda escape... is that it?"     
"Probably, yes."

I see, that makes sense.      
Suda had secured a backup plan in advance, it seems. What was that guy doing with other people's hard-earned money?    

"Well, in any case, the Metropolitan Police Department and the Ministry of Monster Control are now thoroughly investigating, including that person's identity. I'd like you to wait a little longer."      
"Understood. Thank you for your efforts."

I can help with monster subjugation, but I can't help with the investigation of an escaped criminal.     
While Suda is a concern, it's best to leave it to the professionals.

"And while you can leave that to us, I have another job I'd like to ask of you."       
"A job, meaning something dungeon-related?"       
"Indeed. Take a look at this."

Dojima-san spread a map on the table.        
It was a map of Tokyo and its surroundings. And near the center of Tokyo Bay on the map, a red circle was drawn.

"A dungeon has been discovered on the seabed of Tokyo Bay. As you know, seabed dungeons cannot be managed and are extremely 'dangerous'."      
"That's right. If a monster disaster occurs, those monsters would scatter across the world."      
"Precisely. Therefore, I'd like to ask you to 'destroy' this dungeon. Can you do it?"

Dangerous dungeons cannot be overlooked, and besides, the Ministry of Monster Control is currently busy searching for Suda. There's no reason to refuse.       
I answered Dojima-san, "Leave it to me," and accepted the job.

Tl Note: I'm finally home from school, and I can finally get back to translating. I'll try to make releases more stable from now on.
