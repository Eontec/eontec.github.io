Tl: Sam

…


"Oh, Rin-chan, that's so nice. I wanted to go too."

It was night.     
As everyone gathered around the dining table for dinner, Hoshino said enviously.

"When you say 'wanted to go,' you know we're not going for fun, right?"       
"I know that, but... staying home is lonely."

Hoshino pouted, sticking out her lips.     
The topic of discussion was my trip to the seabed dungeon.<!--more-->       
The members going were me, Rin, and Dojima-san. Hoshino was staying home this time.      
Since we started living together, I've been training Hoshino. Perhaps thanks to that, her strength has become even more refined than before.      
So she's skilled enough to be taken along... but unfortunately, Hoshino's underwater aptitude isn't that high. With training, she might be able to go to the deep sea, but it's impossible in just one week. No matter how much she pouts, I can't take her.    

"Please rest assured, Yui. I will fully support Sensei."

Rin said with a smug look, placing a hand on her chest.      
She's usually poker-faced, but ever since she found out she could go to the dungeon with me, she seems more excited than usual. She's a cute one.        

"Ugh, I'm jealous..."      
"Leave it to me this time. I'll teach you how to swim when we get back."        
"Really? Thank you, Rin-chan!"

The two talked amicably.       
Living in the same house seems to have deepened their bond even further. Their closeness makes it hard to believe they only met recently.

"A dungeon in the sea... that sounds scary. Besides Big Bro and Lady Rin, is the other person going to be okay?"

Dagosuke asked, munching on his food.       
Lilicia, by the way, was engrossed in the Nikujaga that Hoshino made and wasn't listening. She's a gluttonous princess.

"You don't have to worry about Dojima-san. He should be better than me in the water. That is, if his skills haven't gotten rusty from all the desk work."        
"Huh... that old man is that incredible, huh? This world seems to have more dangerous people than the one I came from..."

Dagosuke muttered, sounding a little scared.      
It seems there aren't many people in his world who can free dive to the deep sea.

"By the way, Rin-chan, can't Amatsuki-san come back yet?"        
"...It seems not. She might not be able to return today either."        
"Is that so..."

Hearing Rin's words, Hoshino's brows drooped sadly.       
It seems Amatsuki is participating in Suda's search in addition to her usual duties. Knowing her strong sense of responsibility, she must be feeling responsible.       
That it was because she was the one who captured Suda…        
I sent her a message not to worry, but she's not the type to stop just because of that. I had planned to tell her properly next time we met, but it seems that won't happen today.

"That idiot, I wish he'd just get caught already."

I sighed, saying that.      
Well, he's such a show-off, so clues should be found in a few days.     
That's what I thought, but in the week leading up to our dive into the seabed dungeon, no clues about him were found after all.
