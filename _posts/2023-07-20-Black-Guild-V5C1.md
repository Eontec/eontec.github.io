"The camera is good. The angle of view is ...... okay. I'm a little nervous because this is the first time I've ever streamed inside my house."



　One day around noon. I was about to start streaming at home.



　My house is a small 1K rental.

　I cleaned up the house before I started streaming, but I couldn't get rid of the feeling of a man living alone. It was a little embarrassing to stream in a place like this, but Adachi said it would be more popular than renting a studio, so I had no choice but to accept the idea.

　I fixed the drone that I usually fly on a tripod and put my upper body on the floor and a small table in front of it in the angle of view.



"Okay, let's start the delivery."



　I operate my phone and start streaming.

　Then all at once, the number of viewers increased, and in less than a minute, we had 10,000 people.



「Wakotsu!」

「Here comes the delivery!」

「Shachiken strongest!　Shachiken is the best!」

「Thank you for the sudden delivery.」

「 Are you in a dungeon?」

「Could it be a home stream?」

「Thank God for home streaming. I was just out of it.」

「Tanaka!　Thanks for the delivery!/;

「Today's delivery says 【『 Home Delivery 』Tanaka introduces his pet 】, but is it for real?」

「I thought you were going to keep me!」

「What happened to your promise to keep me?」

「There's a bunch of pets in here lol.」

「What are you going to keep?　I don't think I can take care of a dog, maybe a hamster?」

「I'm amazed that he's trying to win over the animal-loving crowd.」

「Why is he wearing a business suit at home?」



　The comments kept pouring in.

　Meanwhile, the number of viewers exceeded 500,000, and the number was growing rapidly. The number of subscribers increased, so the initial growth is totally different.

　I can't believe that so many people gathered at the home of such a dull guy. You never know what will happen in life.



"Hello everyone. My name is Makoto Tanaka. Thank you for coming today."



「Hello!」

「Hello.」

「You're as formal as ever,lol.」

「Tanaka!　relax!」



"As the title says, today I would like to introduce my new pet. It's a bit of a rare breed, so I might surprise you."



「Eh, what is it?」

「Being surprised by a pet is indeed an exaggeration, isn't it?」

「What is it, a Komodo dragon?」

「Maybe it's an elephant.」

「It's not going in the room, is it?」

「Maybe they'd be surprised if he got a viewer.」

「Then you should keep me! (exasperated)」

「Today, too, the squeals of the people who are in love are very energetic.」



　When the comments had warmed up, I put my hand in my breast pocket.

　Then I grab that guy in there and put him on the table.



「Hmm?」

「Huh?」

「What's this?」

「Is it a black caterpillar?」

「No, there's no such thing.」

「It looks like slime.」

「What? Monster?」

「Maybe this kid is from .......」



"This is Shoggoth, the newest member of our family. Come on, say hello."

"Riri!"



　Shogos raises a short hand in a cheerful voice toward the drone as he urges her to greet him. Apparently, he understands the language quite well.



「Sho, Shoggoth-tan!」

「You're alive!」

「That's impossible!　Is he saying he's going to keep Shoggoth! (English)」

「No, I didn't expect this, wow!」

「What? (exclaiming in delight)」

「Why do you think the monsters are so friendly to people (awe)?」

「Because he's Shachiken, isn't it?」

「Shoggoths who used to be objects of fear are now mascots.......」

「Yea!　Ia!　(unintelligible language)」

「Holy shit, Shoggoth-tan's a kita ━━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━！！ 」

「I love this guy, I love him so much.」

「Shogath-tan's screencaps are spreading on SNS so fast. I'm sure he's already an idol.」



　I was a little worried, but it seems that Shoggoth was accepted by everyone. If they become so well known, government extremists won't be able to start exterminating them badly.

　Public opinion is on our side.



“Good job on saying hello."

"Riri......♡"



　When I patted him on the back while praising him, Shoggoth let out a sweet voice.

　The way it looks, it doesn't look very much like a monster.



「Ka, you're too cute .......」

「She's completely turned into a moe character, lol.」

「Is there any chance of her becoming a human and becoming a heroine yet?」

「The heroine race is about to intensify again.」

「Too much of a big hole in the race!」

「When are you going to shake Shogoth-tan's hand ！！？！？？！？！？？」

「I love it, I want to be stroked by Shachiken too.」

「I want to be praised by Tanaka and be kissed by him too!」

「I'm glad you guys aren't wavering.」

Tl Note: My journey got delayed, but I managed to use a friend's laptop for this chapter, maybe there'll be one tommorow, more likely on Saturday(That's when it was rescheduled to)
