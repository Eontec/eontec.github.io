This is one of the first times I'm making an announcement post, and I have already said most of what I wanted to say in the TL note of the latest chapter, but I wanted to make a post to really talk about it.

Welcome to the Oracle Cafe was a novel I started translating a while ago, looking for a second novel to translate. Despite me loving the premise of the series, That sentiment wasn't really shared; maybe it was because releases were slower than when I originally started translating Black guild, or some other reason.

This whole thing coincided with a very down period in my life, followed immediately by a very busy period(Engineering Majors amarite), and I couldn't translate for a very very long time.<!--more-->

Many times during this basically 2 year hiatus, I thought about continuing the translation, but I never really had the motivation to do so. I statred many times but reaally couldn't continue well on it always ended up in just one or 2 releases.

I'm officially back now though, and everything isn't magicallybetter, but I'm in an incomparably better place than I was before; I have a new better laptop(I can still rember posting a chapter on my phone because my laptop was broken).

To the people who were here in 2023 when I started this site, I want to say thanks for being there. A majority of those people will never read this(Completely my fault lol, who looks at dead novels from 2 years ago), but I still want to say it. Especially to those who commented on the chapters. It really gave me the motivation to actuallu translate the novel, and without you, I probably would have stopped translating it after a few chapters, maybe taken it off novel updates. You guys even fought for me when someone else took on the translation, despite the fact that I was already being irregular with releases at that point.

And to the people who are here now, I want to say thanks for being here. You guys allow me to continue translating, knowing I'm not just doing it for myself, but for you as well. I hope you enjoy the chapters, and I hope I can continue to provide you with quality translations, for as long as I can.

Back on Oracle Cafe, I will be translating the chapters that were released in the past 2 years at a leisurely somewhat consistent pace, and I will be posting them on patreon. I will eventually post them here, but it will take a while. I want to make it a supporter perk for now, because my chapter releases will be quite irregular, and I want to focus on Black Guild for now without having to rush translations or provide sub-quality chapters.

Thank you again for your support and remeber to put down a comment if I ever make a mistake in translation, either on the chapter comments, or on the discord. I will try to fix it as soon as I can.

Supporting on Patreon is also really great for me, as I am not in the US, and the currency conversion means that even the smallest amount is a lot for me. It really helps me out. I'm not in any bad financial situation(except being a student), and the only expense I ever have issues with is internet, so do something better with your money because you don't have to give any to me, but if you can, I would really appreciate it.

Peace out, and see you in the next chapter of Black Guild, which will be released in a few hours.(No ads in between the text cuz I wanted my text to be undisturbed)
