「What is that!?」      
「Is it a monster?」        
「Huh, isn't it bad that there's a monster outside!?」        
「No, but it looks different from a normal monster...」       
「It looks like a deep-sea fish that got huge」

The approaching fish looked like a monster at first glance, but it wasn't.       
That was probably just a normal fish that had turned aggressive due to the influence of magic energy.        
Humans evolved into Awakened individuals due to the influence of magic energy. Similarly, other animals can also grow abnormally under the influence of magic energy.         
That being said, such occurrences are rare. They don't happen often.        
However, if you're near a dungeon that emits powerful magic energy, such things can happen.<!--more--> This one probably became like this due to the influence of the seabed dungeon.

"Bluu-bluu-bluu, was it drawn in by our magic energy? Bluu-bluu, what an unlucky fellow."

Dojima-san clenched his fist and kicked his legs towards the giant fish.        
Animals affected by magic energy, unlike Awakened individuals, cannot live long. Even if left alone, they would die in a few days.         
But that doesn't mean they won't cause damage until then. We need to take it down here.        

『GAAAAAHHHH!!』

The giant fish opened its large mouth, attempting to bite Dojima-san.          
Dojima-san delivered a powerful punch straight at the fish.

"Bluu-bluu, take this! Bluu-bluu, Oni Fist!"

At the same instant the fist landed, an incredible shockwave spread through the water. The fish's head, which took the direct hit, dented inward and was sent flying far into the distance. It probably wouldn't survive that.

「Gulp」        
「It got sent flying with incredible force lol」       
「This Minister is too strong」        
「I knew he was strong, but it's amazing to see it in person lol」        
「After seeing this, no other politician would dare heckle him lol」       
「Somehow the loincloth is starting to look cool (confusion)」

Oni Fist is a technique where you punch with concentrated magic energy, in other words, just a straight punch.         
But even a simple straight punch unleashes weapon-grade power when Dojima-san throws it. I heard that before he became an Awakened, Dojima-san once fought a bear with his bare hands and won.        
He said this during a drinking session, so I don't know if it's true or false, but looking at him, it's hard to call it a lie.

"Bluu-bluu-bluu-bluu, did you see that, Tanaka! Bluu-bluu, it flew!"         
"Bluu-bluu-bluu, yes, yes, bluu-bluu, let's go."            
"Bluu-bluu! Bluu-bluu-bluu, wait for me!"

I left Dojima-san, who was posing for the camera, and continued to dive deeper.             
After diving for a while, a large fissure on the seabed appeared. This is the crack where the rumored dungeon appeared, huh? It's quite large.

「Huge」       
「I'm getting scared somehow」        
「Deep-sea images are kinda creepy」       
「The drone's light helps a bit, but it's really pitch black down there」      
「Normal Awakened couldn't come to a place like this, huh?」 

I dove into the fissure.       
I don't know the exact location of the dungeon, but I feel a strong magic energy from the bottom of the fissure. I assume the entrance is there.      
After diving for a few minutes, I finally discovered the entrance to this dungeon.
I arrived faster than I expected. I still have plenty of breath, so getting back doesn't seem like it will be too much trouble either.

"Bluu-bluu, shall we enter?"

After confirming that Dojima-san and Rin were properly following behind, I entered the dungeon.        
For a while, it was a water-filled space, but after swimming a bit, we reached a space with air. Thankfully, there seems to be air inside.

"...Phew. Phew, I haven't swum this much in a long time."

Having reached land, I took a towel from my business bag, wiped my body, and then took out my suit and put it on.

「This is the last we'll see of Shachiken's swimsuit (blood tears)」          
「I wonder if there'll be another swimsuit episode...」        
「As usual, there are many passionate Shachiken fans」         
「Took 10,000,000,000,000 screenshots」      
「Dungeon, you better flood」        
「How much do they want to see a swimsuit lol」       

When I displayed the comments after reaching land, for some reason, there were comments lamenting the loss of my swimsuit. Why do they want to see my swimsuit...? I don't understand. I'd understand if they wanted to see Rin's swimsuit, but there's no point in seeing mine.

"Damn it! I lost!"          
"Phew... We finally arrived."   

While checking the comments, Dojima-san also arrived, and Rin arrived a little after him.           
Alright, everyone's here. Let's quickly conquer this dungeon.
