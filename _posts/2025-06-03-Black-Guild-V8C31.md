"Marriage!　Lilicia, what in the world is going on?"     
"Surprised ...... I didn't expect it to come out that way......."     
"I see, you cut off the retreat by saying it while on stream. That's a good way."

　Hearing Lilicia's sudden marriage proposal, Hoshino, Amatsuki, and Rin had three different reactions.       
　The only one who was calm in this situation right now was Lili, who was lying sprawled out on the table.

"Hm?　Hmm?　Did I say something strange?"     
"It's obvious, isn't it?　Marriage is more of a process......."

　Hoshino explained, but Lilicia looked puzzled and didn't seem to be convinced.       
　If you think about it, Lilithia is an elf, a person from another world. It's natural that people here have different values. The mere fact that the culture of marriage between a man and a woman is common is almost a miracle.

Since the birth of dungeons, the culture of marriage has become more casual than in the past, but it may be even more casual in the other world.     
　I'm sure the elves have their own unique values.

「Shuraba Kita ━━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━!!!!」      
「It's getting exciting.」      
「Oh my god, she suddenly asked him to marry her.」     
「What is this, a video game?」     
「The princess is insane.」     
「It's a harem house.」     
「It's a one-man theme house, right?」       
「It's a girl's prerogative to make bold confessions.」      
「Princess!　Don't get married yet!」 （Crying)
「The child of Shachiken and the elf looks so strong. I wonder if they can use magic.」     
「I don't want to think about a Shachiken who can use magic.」

　I glanced at my phone and sure enough, the comments were exploding.

"Hmmm, isn't it a good idea to just ask someone to marry you out of the blue?"     
"Not that it's not allowed, but, you know, how should I say it ......?"

　Hoshino was confused.       
　Hmm, it's probably difficult to explain.      

"In my world, it is normal for royalty to enter into political marriages. It is considered the princess's job to marry for the sake of friendship or to end a war."

　Hmmm, I see.          
　If she comes from a world with such values, it's no wonder she is so casual in her courtship. Lilicia asked me, one of the few male acquaintances she has, to marry her in order to establish friendly relations with our world.        

 "Ah, so it's not because you like Tanaka-san. Huh... that's good."      
"No, I have a liking for Tanaka, okay?　If I didn't, I wouldn't have asked for a political marriage so quickly."       
"What?"

　Hoshino stiffened at Lilicia's reply.
　My head was still frozen, someone please help me.

"The most important thing for us elves is not beauty or ugliness, but the strength of our magic. Tanaka's magical power exceeds that of even the demon king Lucif. If he came to our country, all the female elves in the country would not leave him alone."

　The magic power is probably the magical element in our world.  
It is still called that, though, because it was named magical element before it was discovered.

　...Still, the fact that the size of the magic essence is what makes it attractive is truly a different world. 

"That's not all. When I was rescued from the Demon King, I felt a strong thrill in my heart. It's the first time I've felt like that. In other words, this is destiny! Come on, let's marry quickly, Tanaka!"

　

Lilicia said strongly, her heart pounding in her chest.        
　The fact that she would so brazenly ask for marriage is just too much. Is this the power of the princess? ......

　Me, Hoshino, Amazuki and the others were unable to speak, and silence ruled the place. 

「It's so awkward, lol.」     
「The air is like hell.」     
「I can see why.」     
「Of all the things to say, you say it when Yui and the others are all here.」      
「Well, the Princess doesn't know that Shachiken and Yui like each other, so ......」       
「Lilicia is so cute, she doesn't know anything about it.」      
「I'm so touched that such a miraculous scene is being streamed.」     
「My heart hurts just looking at it. I'll watch it.」       
「What the hell is going on here?」
