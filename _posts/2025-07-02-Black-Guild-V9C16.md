Tl: Sam


…



I skillfully moved my fishing rod, putting the hook with the Dungeon Worm into the water.        
The bait was fresh, all that was left was to concentrate and wait for a bite.        
Monsters are highly cautious, so I'll wait patiently.

"Oh, I've already got one."         
"Eh?"

I was prepared for a long battle, but Dojima-san's rod was already bending.          
This pull is quite strong. It seems something fairly large has hit.

「So fast」        
「It's that easy to catch, huh?」       
「It's pulling so hard lol」         
「A normal person's arm would probably <!--more-->be ripped off lol」         
「The Minister's rod handling is good (suggestive)」          
「Fishing streams are fun to watch too. I hope he does them regularly」

Dojima-san skillfully reeled in the line.           
Then, seizing the moment when the prey's strength weakened, he pulled the rod sharply.

"Hmph!!"

Splash! With a sound, a large fish appeared from the water.          
Its length must have exceeded two meters at least. It was probably quite a large catch among the sizes that can be fished.          
Dojima-san firmly caught the large fish and laughed happily.

"Ha-ha! This is quite a big one! I'm looking forward to eating it!"         
"Guh-nunu..."

I gritted my teeth, watching him.          
I had planned to catch one first, but he beat me to it. It's bad to be seen looking pathetic when streaming nationwide. I have to try harder.

「Shachiken looks frustrated, so cute」        
「By the way, his killing intent is crazy lol The fish will run away lol」        
「Fish: "Something dangerous is here... I'd better not go near"」       
「Rin-chan also looks worried」        
「Is he not performing well because he's not alone this time?」

Even after that, I changed my location and changed bait, but I couldn't get a hit.            
In the meantime, Dojima-san had already caught three large fish. At this rate, I wouldn't catch a single one.          
It's not a competition, but if this continues, Rin might lose interest in me... I have to do something.

"...Alright."

Having made a decision, I put down my fishing rod.            
Dojima-san noticed this and let out a sound of "Oh?"

"What's wrong, Tanaka? Are you giving up already? Well, it might be difficult to catch up to me now, but..."         
"What are you saying? No, that's not it."          
"Hmm?"

Ignoring Dojima-san, who tilted his head, I put my hand on my suit.          
And in an instant, I stripped off my suit, returning to my swimsuit (with necktie) again.

"It seems the fishing rod isn't working well, so I'll dive in and get it. Dojima-san, please wait."         
"What!? Hey, is that allowed!?"  

「Lol」        
「Too much brute force」       
「What was fishing for, then?」        
「Indeed, it seems faster for Shachiken to just dive in lol」         
「This is already like Yellow ○ Life」         
「Fish: "Please really don't come"」         
「Announcement of ecosystem collapse」           
「Q. I can't catch any fish, what should I do? A. Dive in and catch them.」         
「Only you, who can swim faster than fish, can do that...」          
「Tanaka! Your swimsuit suits you!」        
「His eyes are dead, but his body is ripped, it's irresistible」            
「Took 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 screenshots」

The comments were getting excited for some reason, but I deliberately ignored them.            
They might call me childish, but there are times when I just have to do it.

"Um, Sensei. You don't have to go that far..."

Rin spoke to me apologetically.           
I feel like she's glancing at my pecs and abs, but it's probably just my imagination.

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

"Just wait a little. I'll catch a big one."

I said to Rin, then entered the water with only my sword.           
From the outside, it looked like a small lake, but it's deeper than I thought. No wonder it was hard to catch anything, indeed.

「The inside is quite wide...」          
「Underwater is kinda scary」        
「By the way, is it okay to go in alone?」        
「It's probably not okay, normally」        
「It's Shachiken, so it's fine, right?」        
「Huh, did something move down there just now?」

"Hmm?"

After diving for a while, prey immediately appeared.          
A medium-sized sea dragon, a Sea Serpent. These taste good grilled.

「It's a Sea Serpent, cool」         
「It's going to be lunch after this, huh...」       
「Sea Serpent-kun, run away!」        
「This guy is supposed to be a pretty troublesome monster, but I only feel pity for it」          
「For Shachiken, it's like eel, right?」

『JAAH!!』

The Sea Serpent opened its large mouth wide and attacked, baring its fangs. It seemed to intend to swallow me whole.         
I lured it in until the last possible moment, then kicked the water to dodge just before it bit me.           
Then, getting above the Sea Serpent's head, I forcefully stabbed my sword into its crown.

"Hmph!"

『JAAHH!?』

The Sea Serpent, pierced in its vital spot, let out a loud cry and died.           
Alright, got the ingredients. If it's this big, it should beat Dojima-san's fish.

「Instant kill lol」        
「Sea Serpent: "My screen time was only a few seconds, lol"」       
「Is this a time for laughter?」       
「Got it!」       
「Sea Serpent-kun, we lost a good one...」        
「That's strange, it's supposed to be a pretty strong monster」(Tl: I like the continuity of this first time watcher, and how people no longer care so much about them)       
「It just had bad luck...」

"Bluu-bluu, alright, bluu-bluu, shall we go back?"

Having successfully obtained the ingredients, I tried to return, holding the Sea Serpent.            
Then, I suddenly felt a large amount of magic energy from below. This amount of magic energy... it's at least S-rank, conservatively speaking.

"Bluu-bluu, bluu-bluu-bluu, this is a big one."

A giant shadow wriggled on the seabed.             
Appearing on its black body were two more large eyeballs. Those hollow eyes were completely fixed on me. It seems I've been completely locked on.

「Sooooo big」          
「What is that!?」        
「Too scary」        
「WAAAAAAAAH!?」         
「This is too much like a horror movie!」       
「Run, Shachiken!」       
「Is that a... an octopus!?」       

What appeared was a giant mollusk with countless long legs.             
To describe it in one word: a 'Giant Octopus'. Its size was in the tens of meters. It could easily sink a small ship.        
The name of this monster is 'Kraken'.         
It's one of the most troublesome types of aquatic monsters.            
I remember its legs tasted fragrant and delicious when grilled. It's a shame we just met, but I guess it's time for it to become ingredients.

TL Note: I've decided to actually continue translating Oracle Cafe, but I'm only posting chapters to patreon, because chapters releases are quite irregular, and right now, I want it to be a suppoter perk, rather than a regular release. So, if you want to read Oracle Cafe, please support me on patreon. I will eventually post the chapters here, but it will take a while. 

In other news, I've tried again to apply for Google adsense, and those old time readers will know the things they put me through. I've decided to come back for round 2. So I can move on from this less than optimal ad network I'm on.

I'm going to start an internship next week, but the schedule is quite flexible, so I should be able to keep up with the translations.

Join the discord, It's somewhat easier to make announcements there, and I respond to pretty much all messages.
