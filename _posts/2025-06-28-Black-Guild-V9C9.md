Tl: Sam

…


"Why a loincloth?"       
"Why, you ask? It's always been decided that if you're swimming, it's a loincloth!"

「Lol」        
「What era is this guy from, lol」       
「But the loincloth suits him too well lol」       
「Alright, Shachiken, you should wear a loincloth too」       
「...That's actually plausible」      
「A loincloth boom is coming」 

Comments flowed, even egging me on to wear a loincloth.      
That's just embarrassing. It looks good on Dojima-san, but if I wore it, it would just be comical.

"Sensei's loincloth... it's not bad at all..."

Even Rin said something terrifying.       
Ever since we started living together, she's become more proactive than before<!--more-->. If I let my guard down, I feel like I'll be attacked. Normally, it should be the other way around.  

"A loincloth is fine. I'm already wearing my swimsuit."

Saying that, I quickly stripped off my suit.        
What appeared underneath was not a loincloth, but tight boomerang briefs. I always wear these when I swim.

「EHHHHHHH」       
「Boomerang briefs lol」     
「I can see it」       
「Oh my oh my oh my」      
「Is this Shachiken trying to tempt us by showing his skin?」        
「Concurrent viewers are skyrocketing lol」        
「My female colleague suddenly screamed, she must be watching the stream while working」         
「You're watching it too, as usual」         
「Today's a fan service episode lol」

As soon as I was in my swimsuit, the comments suddenly became a torrent. There shouldn't be any demand for my naked body.       
By the way, I use these because less fabric makes it easier to swim... but since I can't take off my cursed necktie, my appearance has become a bit perverted.

"Alright, then, let's head to the dungeon... Rin, what are you doing?"

I looked to see Rin pointing her smartphone camera at me and furiously pressing the shutter button. And blood was even flowing from her nose.

"S-Sensei, you mustn't expose so much skin, pant, pant."         
"Aren't your words and actions contradicting each other?"        
"Ah... what lewd arm muscles... I must share this with Nee-san and Yui too."

Rin was engrossed in taking pictures. ...She's grown into a complete pervert.        
Where did I go wrong with her guidance? I need to take responsibility.

「Rin-chan is such a funny kid lol」       
「As expected of a wife」        
「Sharing swimsuit photos with the wives, lol」        
「What about me!?」       
「I can't help but cry as I'm left out again」       
「Well, I'm bad with smartphones, after all」       
「Even Dagosuke can use it though...」

"Hey, Rin, how long are you going to keep taking pictures?"      
"...Ah, sorry. I got a little carried away. Shall we go now?"

Rin said, as if nothing had happened, and put away her smartphone. It was hard to believe she had just had a nosebleed.       
When she took off her Ministry of Monster Control uniform, she instantly transformed into a swimsuit. It was white and looked like a tight competitive swimsuit. Although its appearance wasn't particularly special, it was surely a multi-functional swimsuit created by the Ministry of Monster Control.

「EHHHHHHH」       
「It's been strong swimwear until now, so this gives a great sense of relief」          
「This is it, this is it」      
「Cute」         
「This is what the customers want most, but why are the comments the weakest?」        
「The previous ones were too impactful」         
「Rin-chan has such a great figure」       
「The doujinshi will get thicker」        
「I'm so insanely jealous to have such a beautiful wife」

"Sensei, this."

As I was doing warm-up exercises, preparing to dive, Rin handed me a small device.       
What is this? It looks similar to something you put in your mouth when diving, but it doesn't have a tube or a tank.

"What is this?"         
"It's underwater equipment owned by the Ministry of Monster Control. It contains a dungeon-produced plant that generates oxygen. If you hold this in your mouth, you won't have any problems with oxygen for three days."       
"Oh, they have such convenient things now."

I gratefully accepted it.       
With this, it seems even if the dungeon is filled with water, we'll be fine.        
Just as I was about to put it in my mouth and dive, Dojima-san approached with a grinning face.

"What's wrong, Tanaka? Can't you hold your breath to the dungeon without that? How pathetic."        
"...What are you saying, Dojima-san? Of course not. You're getting on in years yourself, Dojima-san, so don't be stubborn and feel free to use it."          
"Wha...!? Do I look like such a coward!? Come on, let's go!"

「Lol, he got retorted」       
「These guys get along well lol」      
「The Minister's face is bright red, so cute」      
「Are these guys moe characters?」      
「Finally, I'm looking forward to it」       

"Alright, let's go."

After bowing to Izumi-san, who was seeing us off, we jumped into the sea.         
Our destination is 200m below the surface. Let's finish this quickly and return home to everyone waiting.
