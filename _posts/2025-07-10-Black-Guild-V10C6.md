Tl: Sam


…



『Lul...?』

Perhaps not expecting its punch to be stopped, the evil god let out a confused sound.       
The opponent put its weight into its fist, trying to crush me, but I firmly stepped on the water's surface and pushed its fist back.

「Evil God-kun is confused lol」      
「Cthulhu: "Scary... why doesn't he die?"」      
「That's true」      
「Viewers don't understand, as usual」      
「By the way, why is he standing on water normally? Can he use Chakra?」      
「Shachiken Ninja Theory」      
「[Bad News] Laws of physics broken」

『Lululu! Lululu! Lululu!!』

The evil god angrily swung its fist down again and again.       
Haha, what incredible power. The dungeon shook with a thud every time it landed.<!--more--> If I let my guard down, I might be defeated.

"Well... it's my turn now."

I clenched my free left fist and punched the evil god's fist back.
Then, its arm violently recoiled, and the evil god lost its balance.

『Iah!?』

The evil god tried to regain its balance by paddling the water.         
I seized that opening, approached the opponent, and punched its large face in the center.

"Hmph!"

With a unique zumyu sound, the evil god's face deeply dented and it fell backward.      
The sensation when I touched it was similar to Kraken, soft and mollusk-like. However, its density and weight were incomparable to the Kraken's.      
It felt heavy and incredibly dense inside. I punched it intending to send it flying, but I could only make it fall backward.      
I grabbed both of the evil god's legs while it was down.      
Then, I spun around horizontally on the spot, building up plenty of centrifugal force, and threw the evil god.

"Soi!"

『Luah!?』

The evil god, flying with considerable momentum, crashed into the wall, then slammed onto the water's surface.      
Phew, that felt good.

「Cthulhu-kun got thrown lol」      
「That's a Giant Swing!」      
「The man who uses pro-wrestling moves on an evil god」      
「The scale is messed up」      
「Looks painful 」      
「Even through the screen, my SAN value drops a little, so why would he touch it? (shudder)」      
「He probably built up resistance from his corporate slave life」        
「Is work more terrifying than cosmic horror...? I'm getting scared of working」

『Lululu... Ooooh!!』

The evil god stood up, roaring as it wriggled the tentacles around its mouth.      
I don't understand its words, but I can tell it's angry. Perhaps its pride was hurt by being thrown. It seems evil gods express emotions just like normal creatures.

『Lululu!!』

The evil god punched me again with a speed unbefitting its massive size.      
I guarded, but due to the weight difference, I was blown backward. Then the evil god flapped its wings and pursued me at high speed.

"Those wings, they weren't just for show, huh?"

I muttered, decelerating by dragging my feet on the water's surface, and landed.      
Then, I dashed and leaped towards the charging evil god, delivering a flying kick to its torso as if to return the favor.

『Buoh...!？』

The power of that blow, which utilized the opponent's momentum, was high, and the evil god's massive body was sent flying backward, landing in the water. Zappaan!! It created a huge splash.

「Too reckless lol」      
「Is this the Kaiju Battle?」      
「Why is he fighting an evil god with bare hands?」       
「Answer: Because he's Shachiken」     
「He can even communicate with an evil god through his fists」        
「The scale is so messed up it's giving me a headache lol」

『Lululu... So...』

It should have been a good hit, but the evil god stood up. It's a tough one.      
As expected of an EX III rank. Its durability is leagues above ordinary monsters. 

"I feel like enjoying this a bit longer... but I can't drag it out too much."

I drew my sword and readied myself.         
From the few exchanges just now, I've grasped the opponent's strength and attack patterns. I might seem like a muscle-head, but fighting with fists is the easiest way to understand an opponent's information. 

"Here I come."

I held my sword horizontally and charged.      
Then the evil god extended countless tentacles from its mouth and attacked.

「Whoa!」      
「Too gross」      
「Vomit!」      
「If he gets caught by that, it looks bad」      
「SAN value direct burial unavoidable」      
「Gore warning」

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

The tentacles attacked all at once, trying to catch me.      
However, something of this level cannot stop me.

"Tachibana Style Swordsmanship, Hanakago (Flower Basket)."(Tl: I have an unreasonable love for his master’s name)

As I swung my sword at blinding speed, a cage of blades formed around me, protecting me.        
It instantly shredded any approaching tentacles, preventing them from getting close to me.

「Amazing!!」      
「Too fast to see, seriously」      
「What is happening...?」      
「Is this a defensive technique?」       
「For a defensive technique, it has too much killing intent lol」      
「Evil God-kun is getting pulverized more and more...」

Having scattered the tentacles with Hanakago, I rapidly closed in on the evil god.       
The evil god tried to counter with tentacles and claws to stop me, but their movements were all monotonous, making them easy to deal with. I dodged everything and unleashed a sword gleam.

"Tanaka Style Swordsmanship, Rekkuu (Rending Sky)."

A giant blade of wind, created by swinging the sword at high speed. It deeply wounded the evil god's torso.        
Bluish-black blood dripped from the wound, dissolving into the water. It looked clearly harmful. I don't really want to touch it.

「He cut it!」      
「Uwooooh!!」      
「Did he do it!?」      
「He won, I'm going to eat」      
「Don't raise a flag!!」      
「Ugh, looks painful」      
「Even evil gods bleed, huh?」

『Buuuuuh... Ooooh...!』

The evil god groaned in pain, clutching its wound.        
However, the wound regenerated in an instant with a shuuu sound. It seems it has high regenerative abilities, just like a Shoggoth.        
Last time, I was able to defeat it by finding its core and destroying it.          
As I was wondering what to do this time, the evil god suddenly plunged its hand into its mouth.

『Ugh, ooooh...』

And then it pulled something out of its mouth.         
It was a thick cylinder, about 10 meters long. A translucent cylinder made of unknown material. It pulled out two of them and showed them.        
What on earth is this thing trying to do?(Tl: Ask for an autograph, maybe)
