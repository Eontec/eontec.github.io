Tl: Sam


…



　First, I had to do something about this atmosphere.     
　I steeled myself and managed to speak.

"Um, Lilicia."    
"Oh, have you decided to marry me?"     
"No, that's not it..."

"Hmm? Do you dislike it? Though I may not look it, I'm the type who'll devote myself to you! My face is well-proportioned, and my figure is outstanding. My magic power is even higher than other elves. If there's anything else you lack, tell me. I'll adjust myself to your preferences."    

「It's painful to live with how charming our princess is.」     
「I want to get married (blood tears)」    
「I love how she's aware of her own charm.」    
「If he refuses or accepts, he'll incur resentment.」    
「I'll accept it if the princess decides... gugigi」<!--more-->    
「He's not accepting it, lol.」   
「[¥30000] Should I send a congratulatory gift?」    
「I-It's not decided yet!」      
「The royal subjects are desperate, lol.」    

　The comments were lively, but the atmosphere in the office was completely chilled, almost to the point of being cold.     
　Hoshino looked like she was about to cry, and Amatsuki was emitting a terrifying killing intent. Rin was looking at me as if expecting something... what should I do?       

"It's not that Lilicia isn't charming. It's just, well, right now. Everyone else is here too..."     
"Everyone? Oh... I see, I understand. So Hoshino and the others also liked Tanaka! I didn't notice that. My apologies."      

　Lilicia said it nonchalantly.     
　Even though it was already known, Hoshino blushed with embarrassment at being told such a thing during the stream.     

"Lilicia, for now, let's stop the stream..."     
"Then you should marry all of them. Adachi told me, isn't polygamy allowed in this country too?"     
"That guy even told her that..."       

　Dagosuke, who has no home, lives on the first floor of this office, but Adachi, who has a family, commutes to the office from home. And while managing the operations, he also teaches Dagosuke and Lilicia about life in this world.     
　I'm not very good at that kind of thing, so I left the teaching to him, but I never thought he'd teach her something like that.     

"Lilicia-chan, that's not the problem..."     
"Calm down a little. That's not something you can decide now."    

　Hoshino and Amatsuki stopped Lilicia. Only Rin remained silent, watching to see what would happen.     

「Things are getting intense.」    
「How will this end?」     
「Well, it's probably going to be postponed, right? It's beyond Shachiken's capabilities.」     
「If he could cut it, Tanaka might be able to do something.」    
「Tanaka! Take responsibility!」    
「I'm curious about Rin-chan's silence.」   
「The princess's brakes are completely broken, it's hilarious lol.」    

　The comments were still incredibly lively.     
　However, the noisy comments were nothing new. Even if I forced this conversation to end now and stopped the stream, it wouldn't be a fatal situation.     
　Lilicia isn't stupid; if I tell her, she shouldn't bring up that topic in front of others anymore. But,     

"...I understand."    
"Huh?"    
"Eh?"   
"What's wrong?"   

　Lilicia, Hoshino, and Amatsuki looked at me with curious expressions.     
　I stood up from my chair and moved a little away from everyone, then with a serious face, I finally spoke the words I had been trying to say but couldn't.      

"Amatsuki, Hoshino, Rin. I want you to marry me. I'll definitely make you happy."     

　Perhaps they didn't understand what I said, as silence dominated the room for several seconds.         
　Ugh, this is more nerve-wracking than fighting the Demon King. But this is something I have to say.

"E-E-E-Eh?! M-Marriage?!"     
"Makoto?! Are you serious...!?"     
"Sensei... I've been waiting for those words."      
"Wait, what about me?"     

　Everyone reacted in their own unique way. Well, it's natural to be surprised when suddenly told something like this.          
　But I didn't say this on a whim.        
　Ever since the three of them confessed their feelings to me, I had been agonizing. Even when my senior, Kujo-in-san, presented me with the option of making everyone happy, I continued to agonize.       
　Could I be so versatile? Would it be insincere? After much agonizing, I finally came to the conclusion that I couldn't choose just one person. Fortunately, I now have some financial stability, so I should be able to support three people.       
　I'm clumsy, so there will probably be many shortcomings, but if everyone supports me, I should be able to manage. Well, that's assuming the three of them accept my proposal.

「He said ittttttt!!」     
「Woooooah!」    
「Seriously?!」    
「It's hereeeeeee!!!!」     
「Shachiken strongest! Shachiken strongest!」     
「Tanaka! Really?」     
「It's the harem route after all.」      
「He's the modern harem king.」    
「Good, no losing heroines then.」     
「The princess hasn't officially joined yet.」      
「She's casually excluded lol.」         
「This will be tomorrow's front-page news.」     
「Y-You guys, calm down kek.」     
「[¥3000000] Here's a congratulatory gift in a hurry.」      
「When's the wedding!?」      
「Of course, you're making Lilicia-tan your wife too, right?」    

"A-A-Ah, what should I do? First, I have to talk to my mother..."    
"As expected of Sensei. I knew you'd say that."    
"You really are something... What were you going to do if we refused?"     
"Hey! What about me?!"       

　I thought the atmosphere would become even more chaotic, but surprisingly, it became amicable.     
　Even if it's legally okay, this path will be a difficult one. I think some viewers will feel disgusted.      
　But I'm not as timid as I was when I was a corporate slave.      
　From now on, I will live for my own happiness. I decided that when I quit my job.     

"Um, um, I'm unworthy, but..."     
"Please take care of me, Sensei."     
"Haa... I guess this is the weakness of being in love..."     
"Tanaka! Are you listening?! What about me?!"     

　I averted my eyes from the still rapidly flowing comment section, straightened my tie, and headed towards everyone.
