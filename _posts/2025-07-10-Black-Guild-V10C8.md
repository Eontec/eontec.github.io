『Riri-taso♪ Riri-taso♪』

The evil god rhythmically called Riri's name, swinging its orange-glowing cylinders.      
Seeing that, Riri made a confused "Rii..." sound.       
I understand that feeling. What on earth is going on? It's too surreal, I don't get it. Someone explain.

「Huh?」      
「What's happening?」      
「Lol」      
「Did he go crazy after getting beaten up by Shachiken?」      
「By the way, he's saying 'Riri-taso,' right? Does he know about Riri-tan?」      
「Ah, I figured out what that cylinder looks like. It's a glow stick.」       
「A glow stick? No way... oh, you're right.」       
「Seriously lol」      
「Swinging a glow stick while calling out your favorite's name, he's just an otaku!」      
「Was the evil god us...?」       
「[Bad News] The evil god was an otaku」       
「Suddenly feel a kinship, damn it」      
「This is already a creepy otaku」      
「For a glow stick, its lethality is too high」<!--more-->

I read the comments and understood.      
I see, so these high-heat cylinders were glow sticks... Wait, how would I have known that?!       
Why does an evil god have glow sticks?  

"Come to think of it, Dagosuke once said there was a Riri fan among the evil gods... Could it be this guy?"

But what should I do?        
The fact that it knows Riri means it's probably not a being born in the dungeon, but a creature from another world.      
If it were completely hostile, I'd be fine with defeating it, but I feel like I might be able to make it an ally.      
Hmm... this is a difficult problem.      
As I was pondering, Dr. Nero spoke to me.

"Tanaka-dono, I'm telling you for your own good. It's impossible to understand that evil god. It's better to deal with it now. Don't say I didn't warn you if it's too late."      
"Thank you for your advice. However, I don't think so. I'm getting along well with this child, after all."

Saying that, I stroked Riri, who was nestled in my chest pocket, with my index finger.       
Perhaps in their world, it's common knowledge that they're incompatible with these beings. But I managed to become friends with Riri and Dagosuke. This evil god might not be an exception.

"...Is that so. If you insist, do as you please."

Hearing my words, Dr. Nero said exasperatedly and turned away.        
Alright, then, I'll try to make contact.

"Um, so, what is it. Thank you for supporting Riri. I'm Makoto Tanaka, Riri's guardian. Nice to meet you."

Saying that, I offered my business card.        
Then the evil god extended tentacles from its mouth and took the business card. Slimy stuff got on my hand, making me go "Ugh," but I endured it. Will this come off if I wipe it...?

「Handing a business card to an evil god lol」       
「And he actually takes it obediently!」       
「It's getting interesting」      
「Business card: "Sorry, I'm dead"」      
「Business card-kun... you were a good guy...」      
「By the way, can it read characters? Lol」      
「But he seems to be reading the business card」      
「He probably understands that there are characters written on it」      
「《Dagosuke》"Why is he exchanging business cards with the evil god while I'm taking a dump????"」       
「Don't take a dump, you octopus!」(That has to be a slur)      
「His timing is too bad lol」

After staring at the characters for a while, the evil god looked at me and clapped its hand, as if it understood something.      
Then it moved closer to me and gripped my hand with its enormous hand.

『Riri-taso, Papa!』

"Eh, Papa? I don't think so... Well, something similar, I guess? Yeah, yeah, yes, yes."

『Iah! Riri Papa!』

The evil god happily swung my hand back and forth.        
It was a fumbling attempt, but communication seemed to be going well.      
It seems it knew about me because it had watched Riri's videos. It must have attacked us earlier because it didn't realize I was that person.      
I wish it had realized sooner, but I can't distinguish monster faces either, so I guess it can't be helped.

「It's a conversation lol」      
「As expected of a corporate slave」      
「How can he do that lol?」       
「Perfect communication」       
「He's fallen」      
「I'm amazed he even conquered an evil god」
「《Dagosuke》"I can't believe the scary evil god would become like that... As expected of Big Bro (awe)"」       
「This fish-man is excitedly typing comments」      
「Too used to the internet」       
「Did you really just touch the internet recently? Lol」

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

The evil god seemed bad at speaking, but we managed to communicate.       
After asking various questions, it seems that, like Dagosuke, it was suddenly transported to this dungeon while living normally.      
It had been depressed because it couldn't watch its usual videos anymore, and when we arrived, it was surprised and attacked. I understand its feelings, but it didn't have to come at us with such murderous intent.

「He's a clumsy one, huh?」      
「Is the evil god a moe character?」       
「There are already works where it's moe-fied, aren't there?」       
「Japan has too many hentai gentlemen」       
「I bet even Evil God-kun doesn't think he's been moe-fied (smiles)」       
「By the way, it's good that they could communicate, but what now?」      
「Indeed. If a monster disaster is going to happen, we have to do something」      
「You're right. I forgot.」

That's right, the original reason for coming to this lowest level was to stop the monster disaster.      
To do that, we need to destroy the dungeon core and break this dungeon.      
The dungeon core is located at the lowest level of the dungeon and is often found inside the dungeon boss. There are also patterns where it's simply placed somewhere, but in any case, the boss guards it, making it difficult to get to.       
We need to investigate which pattern this is. What to do with the evil god will come after that.

"Um, do you know where the dungeon core is?"

『Lulu?』

The evil god tilted its head at my question.        
Hmm? Could it be that it doesn't know? Well, if the core was formed inside its body, it might not notice. But how do I find out?

"Sensei. The Labyrinth Analyzer also has a function to search for dungeon cores. Please use that."       
"Oh, is that so? I'll try using it right away."

I took out the Labyrinth Analyzer and fiddled with its settings.      
Uh... oh, there's a 'Dungeon Core Search Mode.' This must be it.       
I changed to that mode and pointed the Labyrinth Analyzer at the evil god. Then,

"...Hmm?"

The Labyrinth Analyzer's screen displayed 'No Reaction.'     
Perhaps its body was too large to scan completely. Thinking that, I scanned every corner of the evil god... but I couldn't find the dungeon core.    

"Could it be that this guy isn't the boss?"

If I think that way, it makes sense.      
This guy was just accidentally transported to the lowest level and has no relation to this dungeon. In other words, in terms of the previous dungeon, it's in the Dagosuke position, not the Demon Lord Lucif.       
This is bad.      
At this rate, a monster disaster will occur...
