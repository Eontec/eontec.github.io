Tl: Sam


…


　――――Chinatown Oniryu Dungeon, Deep Layer.      
　This dungeon, accessible through a "Gate" that suddenly appeared in Chinatown, is home to a large number of troublesome Oni (Ogres) and Ryuu (dragons).     
　The two races are simply strong and tough, rather than having particularly annoying unique abilities. Crude tricks don't work against these types of monsters. The only way to deal with them is to relentlessly increase one's physical strength and attack with powerful weapons.     
　In the deep layers of such a troublesome dungeon, I was doing a live stream today.     

"――――Ora!!"     

　I grabbed the head of an Enshiryu (Flame-Bearded Dragon) that charged at me and threw it.        
　Its massive body plunged into the dungeon wall, taking several Oni with it. Phew, that made things a little easier.      
　'Ryuu' are unlike the typical 'Ryu' (dragons)(Tl: European vs Asian Gragons)<!--more-->; they are long and slender.     
　In terms of raw strength, they are inferior to Ryu(Tl: Widely inaccurate in reality, Asian Dragons are deities, very different from any ol’ monster), but they are faster and move freely, making their movements difficult to predict. Even I struggled when I first fought one.       

「The dragon-kun is being thrown lol.」    
「Go, Shachiken!」    
「Can you eat dragons, I wonder?」   
「I'm in Chinatown right now and felt a slight tremor.」    
「Even the Oni are scared.」    
「Can't tell which one's the monster anymore.」    

"If I cause this much ruckus, will it finally show itself...?"      

　I checked my surroundings while defeating countless Oni and Ryuu.     
　The purpose of this stream isn't just to dive into this dungeon and rampage. To get back within regular hours, it would be helpful if it showed up soon.     
　As I fought with that thought, a cold killing intent suddenly filled the dungeon.     

『Ruru...』     

　Appearing with a low, muffled voice was a large Oni with black skin.      
　Two twisted, vicious horns grew from its head, and countless scars were etched into its body.     
　As it appeared, the other Oni and Ryuu began to distance themselves from me.     
　An obviously abnormal presence.       

　The name of that Oni is 'Hyakki-Oh Rasetsu' (Hundred Demon King Rasetsu). It's a named monster that inhabits this Chinatown Oniryu Dungeon.        

"You've finally made your appearance. I've been waiting."     

　Drawing my sword, I confronted Rasetsu.     
　Yes, this guy was the main event of today's stream. It's an SS-rank named monster that recently appeared in the middle layers of this dungeon and attacked numerous explorers.      
　Few individuals in the Ministry of Monster Countermeasures can hunt SS-rank monsters.      
　To reduce the burden on Amatsuki and Rin, I made this guy the highlight of my stream. Since it's a highly anticipated monster, many viewers would come too.      

"Now, it's time for work."      
"Guooooooh!!"     

　Rasetsu let out a great roar and swung down the bloody, heavy club it held with all its might.      
　That would hurt if it hit. I deflected its attack with my sword, then quickly rushed forward and landed a kick to its abdomen.     

"Gaa...?!"    

　Rasetsu recoiled, its face contorted in pain. The damage doesn't seem deep; it's a tough one.      

「Rasetsu-kun's doing well.」     
「That's a good set of abs!」    
「As expected of a named monster.」     
「Thanks to Shachiken working so hard, the number of named monsters has decreased recently.」      
「I never thought he'd defeat Barbatos of Thunder without using both hands lol.」      
「My favorite was when he tore apart Sirene of Flash with his bare hands.」       

『Guu... Gaaaah!!』     

　Perhaps angered by the damage I inflicted, Rasetsu let out a loud cry and put power into the club it held.     
　Then, the club began to emit crackling purple electricity. It seems to be a weapon that generates special electricity when magic power is flowed into it. It's rare; it would probably fetch a high price if sold.     

『Gaah!』

　Rasetsu raised its club and attacked.     
　If I handled it the same way as before, I'd probably get numb from the electricity. If it thought that far ahead, it's quite clever.     

"You thought well... but your movements are too monotonous."

　I waited until the last moment, then dodged the attack just before it hit, leaping into the air.     
　I floated above Rasetsu's head, adjusting my posture lightly in mid-air, and with the tip of my sword pointed at the ground, I dropped towards Rasetsu's body.    

"Tachibana-style Swordsmanship, Parachute."(Tl: weird name)

　With the momentum of the fall, I thrust the tip of my blade into Rasetsu's neck.     
　Rasetsu moved its neck, causing my aim to shift slightly, and the blade pierced its collarbone instead, but even this should deal a decent amount of damage.     

『Guu... Aaah!!』

　Rasetsu swung its arm to ward me off.      
　I temporarily moved away from Rasetsu's body, but my target remained its neck. Now, with it concentrating magical elements on regenerating the wound it just sustained, its defenses are thin.       
　In this state, finishing it off will be easy.     

"Tanaka-style swordsmanship, Blink."(changed waga-ryu(My own style) to Tanaka-style)    

　The sword, once sheathed, was drawn again, and an invisible flash of steel cut through the air.     
　Rasetsu reacted for a moment, but in its injured state, it couldn't evade, and its neck was cleanly severed!     

『Ga...!』

"You were strong... but you had the wrong opponent."      

　As I landed, Rasetsu's massive body crashed to the ground.      
　Phew, I managed it. It was a tough opponent, but it was easier to deal with since it didn't use any strange techniques.     

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

「Ooooh!」      
「He did it!」     
「Even Rasetsu was easy, that's insane.」      
「Shachiken strongest! Shachiken strongest!」    
「His opponent was too bad, as always.」     
「Rasetsu was defeated, huh... a disgrace to named monsters.」    
「How many named monsters do you think he's hunted?」     
「Now it'll be easier to explore the Chinatown dungeon. Thanks.」     
「Thank you, Shachiken!」      

　After defeating Rasetsu, a flood of congratulatory comments appeared.     
　This moment genuinely makes me happy. For me, dungeon exploration in my corporate slave days was lonely and solitary. If I can be praised this much, then my efforts were worth it. 

「Even so, Shachiken's been working hard lately.」     
「The high streaming frequency is helpful.」     
「Well, he has to earn money for his wives, after all lol.」     
「True, lol.」     
「[¥20000] Today's congratulatory gift... I mean, subjugation reward!」      
「Congratulatory gift, lol.」     
「Let me send a super chat for the birth celebration soon lol.」     
「Shachiken as a dad, huh.」     
「You're getting ahead of yourselves lol.」      
「Are you still working overtime (implies something else) at night???」      
「That's too low, lol.」     

"…………"

　Looking at the teasing comments, my face became expressionless.      
　If I get embarrassed, I lose. I just need to make these guys happy.      

"Now, I'll collect the materials and return to the surface. I would appreciate it if you could stay with me for a little longer."     

「Hey, don't run away!」       
「Properly explain how your cohabitation is going!」      
「I wish I could live under the same roof as Shachiken...」      
「Make Yui-chan happy!」       
「If you make the princess cry, I won't forgive you!」      

　The viewers were noisy and clamoring.       
　Gracefully ignoring them, I collected the materials, returned to the surface, and ended the stream.      
　Seriously, ever since that proposal stream, there have been so many comments like these, and it's troublesome.      
　Thinking about what to do, I returned to the office and opened the door to go inside.     

"I'm home~"     
"Oh, welcome back, Tanaka-san! I was watching the stream, good work!"     

　It was Hoshino, who appeared with cute pattering footsteps.     
　She had an apron on and was holding a ladle, as if she had been cooking. She gave off such a strong new wife vibe that I almost mistook us for being already married.     

"Dinner will be ready soon, so please relax for a bit."        
"Hoshino... you'll make a good wife."     
"Eh?! Um, then... I look forward to working with you..."     

　Hoshino, saying that shyly, turned around and went back inside the office. There's no way my fiancée could be this cute.     

"Haa, I still can't believe it." 

　As a result of that proposal, I ended up getting engaged to Hoshino, Amatsuki, and Rin.      
　Not married, but engaged. We haven't registered our marriage yet, but all three accepted my proposal.      
　There was talk of registering our marriage immediately, but with Lilicia and Dagosuke, things are quite chaotic right now. We decided to register once things settle down.      
　Still, just a few months ago, I was on a direct path to being single, and I never imagined I'd have three cute wives. Life truly is unpredictable.      

"Riri!"      
"Oh, sorry, Riri was with me too."    

　As I was thinking, Riri popped her head out of my suit and protested.       
　Sometimes Riri also says "Marry!", but she probably doesn't understand the meaning. I want to believe she's just imitating…      
　She's getting smarter day by day, so I often wonder if she'll be able to converse normally someday.      
 
"Oh, you're back, Big Bro! I was watching the stream!"     
"Hmm? Dagosuke?"      

　As I took off my suit jacket, Dagosuke came over.      
　When I first met him, he was just wearing ragged pants, but now he's different.      
　Jeans and a white short-sleeved T-shirt, casual clothes that a young person would wear. It's truly surreal to see a fish-man wearing them.      
　But it's kind of funny how it suits him.       

"You've really adapted to this world..."       
"You mean these clothes? Well, in my old world, I couldn't wear such nice clothes, you see. The food is also delicious, so I'm glad I came here."       

　Dagosuke laughed happily.      
　There's a reason why he wears such clothes. It's to nullify the mental pollution effect.      
　Apparently, research results show that Dagosuke and Riri's mental pollution effect weakens as their public recognition increases and their appearance becomes more approachable.      
　Thanks to Dagosuke's modernized appearance and increased recognition, ordinary people can now look at him without issue. He even went to a fan event the other day. Of course, with government escorts.       
　Since his appearance is so different from ordinary humans, I was a little worried at first whether he would be able to adapt well to this world, but it seems my worries were unfounded.       
　More of a problem is…       

"I've been waiting, Tanaka! Today, you'll marry me too!"     

　A loud voice echoed through the office.       
　Looking, I saw Lilicia, dressed in drab room wear that hardly seemed fitting for a princess. What kind of shirt was that? It said "Warawa"(Tl: Humble presenting first person pronoun common to women)  on the chest, was it some Lilicia merchandise?      



Tl Note: I'm not fully back yet, But in about a week's time, I'll have free time I havent had in years, I'll pick up translating this novel again
