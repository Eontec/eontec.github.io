Tl: Sam

「What is that monster!?」       
「An octopus?」        
「It's too big...」       
「Oh no, too scary」       
「Oh, it's a Kraken. That's a pretty rare monster」         
「Looks strong (small impression)」        
「I can't handle being in the water, it's too scary... ugh」        
「That size, it's easily as tall as a building, right?」       
「Hee, surely it's impossible to fight that underwater?」  

The Kraken is a monster that looks like a super-giant octopus.       
Its rank is 'S'. Its strength is comparable to that of a Tyrant Dragon.        
But if you asked an adventurer whether they'd rather fight a Kraken or a Tyrant Dragon, most would choose the Tyrant Dragon<!--more-->.         
That's because the Kraken lives underwater. When fighting it, you inevitably have to fight in the water.        
Underwater, you can't breathe and can't move like you can on land. Usable magic is limited, and attacks with weapons are weakened.          
In such a state, you would probably lose even to an opponent you could defeat on land.

『Lululu...』

The Kraken, fixing its hollow eyes on me, moved its clearly more than eight legs and approached. It seemed to think that lunch had arrived.             
However, unfortunately... lunch is 'you'.

「Shachiken's smiling, lol」       
「This is scary too」        
「He's probably thinking 'You're lunch'」        
「Strange, the Kraken is starting to look delicious」       
「He wouldn't actually eat it, right...?」         
「He's the man who ate a Shoggoth, you know?」        
「Ah (understood)」        
「Today's lunch has been decided, it seems」       

I moved my legs like a dolphin and rapidly accelerated.         
This was a big catch I finally found. I couldn't let it escape.

「Still fast lol」       
「He's a human torpedo」      
「His movements are too creepy lol」      
「Kraken, run!」      
「This is the only place where you can watch a stream of a necktie-wearing swimsuit man with a sword charging at a Kraken at explosive speed lol」      
「No one else would have this」      
「When you write it down, it makes no sense at all」

『Luu!? Luuah!!』

The Kraken let out a surprised cry, then tried to intercept me with its countless legs.      
There were many, but their speed wasn't that fast. I moved by weaving through the gaps between its legs to approach.

「His movements are really creepy (compliment)」      
「Kraken-kun is surprised, lol」      
「Of course, if a necktie-wearing swimsuit man with a sword charges at you, you'd be scared」      
「Indeed lol」      
「But is this okay? Aren't there too many legs?」      
「No matter how much Shachiken, if he gets caught underwater, it looks bad...」

Perhaps sensing danger from my swimming, the Kraken desperately moved its legs to try and catch me.      
Octopus legs attacked from all directions. With so many, it was a hassle to dodge them all. I swung the sword in my hand and met them head-on.

"Bluu-bluu-bluu-bluu, Tachibana Style Swordsmanship, Bluu-bluu, Flash!"

A sword gleam flashed, slicing through the octopus legs with ease.      
The Kraken's surface is slimy, making it difficult for blades to cut through, but once you get the knack, it's not hard to slice. The trick is to cut it all at once with a forceful swing.

"Bluu-bluu, let's go!"

『Luuah!?』

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

Breaking through the octopus legs, I closed in further on the Kraken.      
I remembered this one also had a very high regeneration ability. It couldn't be defeated by just a few scratches.      
The target should be the spot between its eyes. Just like a normal octopus, that's the Kraken's weak point.  

『Lululuah!!』

The Kraken, sensing danger, deployed a massive number of legs in front of me like a shield. But my aim was already set. A mere obstruction of my vision wouldn't stop my attack.      
I gripped my sword tightly with both hands and swung it down towards the Kraken.

"Bluu-bluu-bluu-bluu, Tanaka Style Swordsmanship, Bluu-bluu, Adamant Sword: Bluu-bluu-bluu, Ten Thousand Slashes!"

THUMP!! With a roar, the water split…

The shockwave I unleashed not only split the water but also bisected the Kraken's legs and the body hidden behind them.

「Whoa!?」      
「Hee!」      
「I was surprised lol」      
「What is this?」      
「The sea can split, huh...?」      
「Kraken-kun split in half, lol」      
「Octopuses have their weak point between their eyes, so he aimed there, I guess?」      
「No, this has nothing to do with weak points anymore」      
「Indeed... lol」      
「His power is still too insane」      
「POWER!」

The Kraken, split in two, finally died and stopped moving.      
Phew, it's big enough for a good meal. This makes for a nice souvenir.
