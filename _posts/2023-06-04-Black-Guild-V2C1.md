…


"Fuah ...... good night's sleep."

　It is around noon the day after the retirement fiasco.

　I wake up without an alarm for the first time in a long time.


　I haven't had such a pleasant morning in months...... or even years.
<!--more-->

　I couldn't sleep well on my occasional days off because of the dread of the next day's work. From now on, I can sleep as much as I want every day, and it makes me feel lighter.


　But well, my wallet will be lighter too. ......


　My heart sinks when I think about it.

　I don't think the Black Dog Guild will give me a decent severance payment.

　Suda has been arrested and the guild will effectively be dissolved. No one would want to rebuild that company.


"The remaining employees will have a hard time, and you can't just walk in there and ask them to give you a severance payment. ...... They're victims too."


　Call me naive, but I'd give up getting severance pay.

Besides, I didn't have time to spend money when I was a corporate employee, so I've been able to save a little. Well, it's not that much because my salary was low to begin with.


　But I'm still hungry...... I fell asleep as soon as I got home last night. Maybe I should go out for something to eat.


　As I am thinking this, my phone vibrates as if on cue.

　I look at the screen and see a message from Adachi.


《I guess it's about time you got up?　We have something to talk about, so let's go out for dinner.》



"...... Did that guy plant a camera in my house?"


　I get a little scared and look around the room, but I don't see anything like that.

　His perceptive skills are a bit frightening.


"I'm a little hungry, so I'll go. I've got some things I want to talk about."


　I quickly get ready and leave the house.

　I put on my business suit as usual. I haven't been out for a few years now, so I have nothing else to wear. ......


　I'd like to go shopping for clothes next time. ......


◇　◇　◇


"Hey, Tanaka!　I saw your stream!　That was a good romp!"


　I go to a nearby family restaurant and meet up with Adachi. Like me, he was dressed in a suit and tie.

I wonder how long it's been since I've eaten out.　I usually just eat at convenience stores or supermarket bento boxes. I do eat some of the food in the dungeon, though.


"I've been eating at convenience stores and supermarkets. What would happen if people find out?"

"Oh, you're already a celebrity, huh?　It's hard being popular."

"I'm going home."

"Hey, I'm sorry!　I'm kidding, I'm kidding!"


　He desperately tries to stop me, and I have no choice but to take my seat.


"You always say three words too many."(Tl: I love their frienship dynamic)

"I'm sorry, I just felt like talking a lot. You can ask for as much as you like as an apology. It's a retirement gift."


　I don't think it's a retirement gift to go to a family restaurant, but as an unemployed person, it's a big help to me.

　I call up the waiter and order without hesitation.


"Extra large cheeseburger and fries. And this steak too. ...... Yes, the biggest size you can get. Please add a large serving of rice too. And a big curry plate and the largest pasta plate. And the drink bar and the pancake tower. That's all for now."

"That's a lot!"


　I finish my order, despite Adachi's disgusted look.

　I'm sure that's all I need.


"Hey, Tanaka!　You're asking too much, it's just a family restaurant!　You're going to run out of money!"

"You'll have a great wife. It's a good thing."


　Seeing Adachi scowling, I smiled at him.

　You underestimated my stomach.


"I forgot you're an active explorer ....... You move around so much, of course you're going to eat."

"I guess so."

"You know, the dark circles in your eyes have gotten a lot better. You look a little healthier."


　It's true that when I was a corporate employee, I had a dead face.

　The face I saw in the mirror in the morning had recovered to the point of near-death. I wish I could go back to the face of the living.


"By the way, Adachi, what is it that you want to tell me?"

"Ah, Well, let's get started while we wait for the food to arrive.."


　Adachi took a document out of his business bag and put it in front of me.

　The document had letters written on it


　The title of the document was "Makoto Tanaka, The Road to Becoming a Popular Streamer."


"This is ......."

I made it in my spare time from work," he said. You don't know much about streaming anyway, do you?　But don't worry, I'll make sure I'll make you a world-class streamer."


　Adachi sipped the remaining Coke from the bottom of the bottle with a straw and said this with a sly grin on his face.
