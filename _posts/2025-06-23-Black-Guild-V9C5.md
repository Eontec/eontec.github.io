It is rare for dungeons to appear in water. Most dungeon entrances appear on land.        
I myself have only entered underwater dungeons a handful of times. But even then, they were only in shallow waters or lakes. I've never entered a dungeon born on the seabed.       
The inside of the dungeon will likely also be full of water. There should be many situations where we have to swim. This will undoubtedly be one of the most difficult dungeons I've ever entered. 

"How deep is that dungeon?"      
"The entrance to the 'Tokyo Bay Seabed Dungeon' is located at a depth of about 200m. Investigations are not yet complete, but there shouldn't be much deviation from that."      
"That's quite deep..."   
<!--more-->

Indeed, just getting there will be tough.      
Even veteran explorers often can't move well at all underwater.

"Apparently, a large fissure appeared on the seabed at the same time the dungeon emerged. And the innermost part of that fissure is the dungeon's entrance."         
"That's why it's so deep, then."        
"Yes. We have to go into the fissure, but it's narrow, so naturally, we can't use a submarine. You'll have to free dive."        
"Ugh, that's a drag..."

I thought I would at least be taken to the entrance.        
Well, a depth of about 200m should be fine, though.

"Oh, don't worry. I don't intend to leave it all to Tanaka alone. Underwater dungeons are too dangerous for one person, so we'll send personnel from our Ministry of Monster Control." 

Dojima-san said, then looked at his secretary, Izumi-san, who was standing behind him.

"Izumi-chan, are there any staff available around next week who are suited for underwater missions?"       
"For staff with underwater aptitude, let's see..."      

Izumi-san operated her tablet device to search.       
I appreciate the help, but I'm a bit reluctant to dive with someone I don't know. I'm shy, you see.

"Ah, I found a good person. Ayakawa Rin will be available from Wednesday onwards."        
"Oh! That's good! Ayakawa certainly has high underwater aptitude. Her compatibility with you is also good, so she's perfect."     

Indeed, with Rin, I can confidently leave my back to her.       
Besides, she said she wanted to dive into a dungeon with me again recently, so I can grant that wish.

"So, is it settled that Rin and I will go?"         
"That would be fine, but... as a precaution, I'd like to bring one more person. Izumi-chan, isn't there anyone else?"

Dojima-san asked, but Izumi-san shook her head.

"As for those with underwater aptitude, there are no others. Amatsuki Kanade also has high underwater aptitude, though not as high as Ayakawa Rin, but if both of them go out, there will be no one to guard Lilicia-san."          
"Hmm... I see."

Dojima-san crossed his arms and pondered what to do.       
I think I'll be fine with Rin, but Dojima-san seems uneasy.       
Before the Ministry of Monster Control was established, Dojima-san was a Vice Admiral in the Maritime Self-Defense Force. He probably knows the dangers of the sea well.       
<div data-nat="424166"></div>
That's why he's trying to send me off with thorough preparations.     
But if there are no people, there's nothing that can be done. Dagosuke, who looks like an aquatic creature, might be useful, but since we're protecting him, I can't take him to a dungeon.         
I can't think of anyone else I know who can free dive to deep sea... What should I do?

"Hmm, any good ideas...? Oh, that's it!"

Dojima-san said, as if he had just thought of a brilliant idea, then took out his notebook from his chest pocket and flipped through it.      
Then, muttering "Hmm, hmm, this will work," he put the notebook back in his pocket and opened his mouth.

"Tanaka! I found a good person! You'll agree with this one!"        
"Eh, there was such a person? Who is it?"

When I asked, Dojima-san grinned and named an utterly unexpected person.

"It's me! I'm going to that dungeon too!"       
"I see, Dojima-san is... wait, what!?"

Both Izumi-san and I were surprised by the unexpected proposal.         
The idea of Dojima-san accompanying us had completely slipped my mind.

"I'm a good swimmer and skilled; there shouldn't be any problems."       
"No, certainly, your combat power is more than sufficient, but are you sure? Aren't you too busy to dive into dungeons?"

I shifted my gaze to Izumi-san, who nodded her head vigorously.        
However, the man himself was completely set on going.

"I've been thinking I need to get some exercise. It's true that work is piled up... but a day or two should be fine. The police are leading the Suda case, so there's nothing I can do, anyway."        
"B-but, you still have work next week..."

Izumi-san tried to dissuade Dojima-san with a troubled look.      
But Dojima-san was already completely committed to going. It would probably be impossible to stop him once he's like that.      
But even so, I'll be diving into a dungeon with Dojima-san again.       
I'm actually looking forward to it a little.
