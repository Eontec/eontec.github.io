Tl: Sam      
      
      
…      
      
      
      
"Ooooh! Outside, outside! It's been a long time since I've been outside, Tanaka!"      
      
　Lilicia shouted with high spirits as she stepped out of the Ministry of Monster Countermeasures.      
　There were many pedestrians in the city, but no one paid any attention to us. It seemed the perception-obstructing magic tool Lilicia was wearing was working correctly.      
　Lilicia noticed this and smiled smugly. She had been stuck inside the house for so long. She must be happy to be able to go out like this.      
      
"Hee hee hee, no one is noticing me. This is fun."      
      
　Lilicia was dressed in normal clothes today instead of her usual elven garb.      
　However, Lilicia is tall, has a good figure, and a very beautiful face, so she stands out a lot. She was wearing a cap, but her aura couldn't be completely hidden.      
　Without the perception-obstructing magic tool, she would have instantly drawn attention.      
      
"Alright, let's go, Tanaka! Today, we're going to play until we drop!"      
"Sounds good. I'll do my best to escort you and make sure you're satisfied."<!--more-->      
      
　When I said this and offered her my hand, Lilicia lit up with a dazzling smile and happily took it.      
　I never thought a corporate slave like me would have a day where I would escort a princess. Life is unpredictable.      
      
      
◇　◇　◇      
      
      
"But are you really okay with the train? We could have taken a car."      
      
　I asked Lilicia when we arrived at the nearest station.      
　I thought a car would be much easier, but it seemed her idea was different. Lilicia shook her index finger from side to side and said, "Tut, tut, tut."      
      
"You are naive, Tanaka. Riding the train like this is also an important experience. I've ridden in a car several times, but not a train or bus yet. I believe it is important to experience the culture of this world."      
      
　Hearing that, I felt ashamed of my shallowness.      
　Lilicia didn't just want to go outside to play. In her own way, she was trying to learn about this world.      
      
"I haven't been in this world for long, but I like it here too. That's why I want to know more and like it even more. I believe that doing so is the shortest path to connecting the two worlds."      
"......You're right. Then let me help you with that today."      
"Yes, I'm counting on you, Tanaka."      
      
　We lined up and went to the ticket machine.      
　Lilicia fumbled slightly but managed to buy her own ticket. It seems she learned how to buy one from a video. She's a studious princess.      
      
"Oh, it's here! This is a live train, how amazing that iron bigger than a dragon can move this fast."      
"Hey, watch your step. It's dangerous."      
"Hahaha! I'm not a child, you know! A mere step like th—Owaah!?"      
      
　Lilicia tripped on the step while boarding the train and stumbled.      
　Having somehow predicted this, I stepped in front of her to catch her. Since it was instantaneous, we ended up in a position as if we were embracing, which was embarrassing. She might get angry, but I hope she forgives me since it was unavoidable.      
      
"Whoa. Are you okay?"      
"U-Un. Th-Thank you, Tanaka."      
      
　Lilicia suddenly became quiet and quickly moved away.      
　She had turned her face away, so I couldn't see it, but her ears were bright red. I wonder what was wrong.      
      
"Let's find a seat for now. What's wrong? Aren't you going to sit here?"      
"I-I'm fine sitting alone!"      
      
　Saying that, Lilicia sat down in a seat a little distance away.      
　Did I do something that offended her? I really don't understand the elven heart.      
      
      
◇　◇　◇      
      

<div data-nat="424166"></div>
      
"Ooooh! A panda, a panda! There's a real panda, Tanaka! It's so cute to see it in person!"      
"Hey, hey, don't run so much, you'll stand out."      
      
　Lilicia was ecstatic, having found the animal she was looking for.      
　Although the bracelet makes it difficult for other people to recognize her as Lilicia, drawing too much attention might still lead to recognition. I was nervous, but the people around us just chuckled and didn't realize it was Lilicia.      
　It might look like a college student is just getting overly excited. That's embarrassing in its own way, but I guess it's safe.      
      
"Aren't there pandas in your world?"      
"No. I never thought a bear with black and white patterns could be so adorable. We have bears with red and blue patterns that control fire and ice, but they are not very cute."      
"The creatures in your world are generally quite dangerous..."      
      
　It seems impossible to create a zoo with animals from her world.      
　That's probably why she finds the zoo so incredibly new and enjoyable.      
      
"Tanaka! What is that?!"      
"That? Oh, that's soft-serve ice cream."      
      
　Lilicia pointed at the soft-serve ice cream a child had bought from a concession stand.      
　Since Lilicia has never been outside, she's only eaten what has been served at the dining table. She has eaten ice cream that Hoshino occasionally buys, but she hasn't had a chance to try soft-serve.      
      
"Soft-serve ice cream... what a sweet-sounding name. It must be delicious..."      
      
　Lilicia kept glancing at me with a look of desire.      
　Lilicia often doesn't ask for things directly but wants me to figure it out. It's a little troublesome, but if I think of it as her way of being spoiled, it's quite cute.      
      
"Alright, alright, I'll buy you one, so pick a flavor."      
"Mu! Really?! As expected of Tanaka, my future husband!"      
      
　Before I could retort, who is your future husband, Lilicia ran towards the concession stand.      
　She's really energetic. Is this the backlash from being cooped up at home all this time? I followed after her at a light jog.      
      
"They have vanilla and strawberry flavors."      
"Muu, this is a difficult choice... such a difficult dilemma is rare..."      
      
　Lilicia was genuinely agonizing over the soft-serve illustration.      
　I wondered if it was really that hard of a decision, but for her, who rarely gets to go out, choosing the flavor of soft-serve ice cream must be a very important matter.      
      
"If you're struggling, there's also the option of a mixed flavor."      
"Mixed! Does that mean I can enjoy two flavors at once?! How luxurious...!"      
      
　Lilicia's eyes sparkled.      
　It seemed the mixed flavor was the winner.      
　I ordered two soft-serve cones from the lady at the stand and took them. Then Lilicia peered at me as if she noticed something.      
      
"Hey, Tanaka, aren't you going to take the receipt? Adachi often tells you not to forget to get one."      
"Hmm? Oh, I don't need the receipt. Because this date isn't work, is it?"      
      
　Many people might consider escorting a princess from another world to be work, but to me, I'm just here to enjoy myself with Lilicia. I don't intend to expense it with a receipt.      
      
"Hmm... is that so. You don't consider it work, Tanaka. I see, I see♪"      
"W-What is it?"      
"Nothing at all♪ Come on, let's go to the next place!"      
      
　And so, I spent the day on a Tokyo date, being led around by the spirited princess.
