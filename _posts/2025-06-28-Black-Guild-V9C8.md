"---So this time, we're diving into the dungeon that appeared here in Tokyo Bay. The drone has also been modified to handle deep sea conditions."

I explained the content of this stream in front of the camera.     
The drone I had been using so far was indeed waterproof. But this time, our destination is 200m deep, and we might need to dive even deeper. It would be difficult for the old drone to withstand that.      
So I asked Adachi to further increase the drone's water resistance. It apparently cost several million yen since they used dungeon materials, but it's a necessary expense.

「Now it's the sea, busy as <!--more-->always lol」     
「But deep-sea streaming is rare, so I'm looking forward to it」       
「Underwater dungeons are indeed rare」         
「Wait, does that mean we get to see Shachiken's swimsuit...?」        
「Thud (sound of falling chair)」        
「The conversation's changed」      
「Oh my, a swimsuit episode? My excitement's through the roof」        
「●REC」        
「It's reassuring that the viewers' focus hasn't wavered」       

For some reason, the viewers started getting excited about something nonsensical.        
There's no demand for my swimsuit, surely. Have they lost their minds from watching too many dungeon streams?      
I've learned from streaming that if I touch on these topics, they become unmanageable, so I'll move on quickly.   

"Underwater work is dangerous without a buddy, so we have a guest this time. Rin, come here."         
"Yes. Hello everyone, I'm Ayakawa Rin, Makoto Tanaka's wife."

Rin said, making a peace sign with both hands and greeting the drone.        
This girl, with her poker face, went straight for it from the start…

「Lol」       
「It's Rin-chan!」       
「It's been a while since the Slime Dungeon」       
「Her self-introduction title isn't 'Ministry of Monster Control' but 'wife,' lol」        
「You've got a good look about you」        
「Kii! You thieving cat!」      
「Looks like we have some obvious jealous fans here」        
「Seriously, can we see Rin-chan in a swimsuit too!?」     
「Indeed, that's just as good as seeing Shachiken in a swimsuit...」       
「How high is the demand for Tanaka's swimsuit... lol」      

With Rin's appearance, the comments intensified.       
Everyone must be happy since it's been a while since she was on stream. It makes me happy when Rin is popular too.        
Well, I could talk with Rin a bit longer, but there's someone fidgeting off-screen, so I'll call them too.        

"Actually, we have one more guest this time. Please come out."           
"Wah-hah-ha! You've waited long enough! This time, I, Dojima Ryuichiro, will also be participating!"

「Huh?」      
「Eh?」      
「Ehhhhhh!?」           
「Seriously!?」       
「The Minister, lol」       
「Minister, what are you doing!?」       
「He's finally here」        
「Why is the Minister here...?」         
「Does that mean we get to see Dojima-san's swimsuit too? (Confused)」     
「That's too much confusion」

When Dojima-san appeared, a flurry of confused comments flowed in all at once.         
Well, it's not surprising. When was the last time Dojima-san publicly dived into a dungeon like this? Wasn't it back during the Imperial Palace Underground Dungeon incident? Since then, his subordinates, primarily Amatsuki, have been handling fieldwork.

"As long as I'm here, I'll smash that seabed dungeon flat! Just you wait and see!"

Dojima-san enjoyed conversing with the viewers in a cheerful mood.          
He's always liked being in the spotlight, so he probably has high aptitude as a streamer. Perhaps he was envious after watching my streams.

"Alright, we've finished our greetings, so shall we go?"

Dojima-san said, then stripped off his expensive-looking suit.         
Then, Dojima-san was wearing nothing but a white loincloth. He was wearing something like that under his suit...?

「The loincloth suits him too well lol」       
「His muscles are amazing」        
「He's too ripped lol」        
「He's probably the only Minister who looks like a bodybuilder...」         
「●REC」        
「So the film crew was here too」       
「【Good News】For me, who loves handsome older men, my drool won't stop」          
「This stream accepts all sorts of fetishes, huh?」
