"Haa...... I'm really tired”

　I muttered to myself in the car after completing the raging schedule with Lilicia.     
　The car I was riding in was a special limousine, which is said to be impervious to monster attacks. It was made of dungeon-made materials. If that's the case, human weapons won't even get a scratch on it.

　In the back seat is me and Dojima-san. Lilicia was sitting in the passenger seat, looking at the scenery with interest.       
　Amatsuki and Dagosuke were there at first, but Amatsuki went off to another job on the way, and Dagosuke went back to the Ministry of Monster Control vs. Lilicia, who looked more like a human, had more of a role to play out front.

　Outside the window, it was already nighttime and the lights of the buildings were twinkling.        
　I used to work fine at this hour, but lately I'm sleepy because I've been living a life of going to bed early. I've gotten used to a healthier lifestyle, too.

"Still, don't you think you packed in too much work so soon after you got home? You could have taken a day off."      
"I wish I could have done that.  But if I don't finish it early, things will go wrong. Lilithia is very valuable, and we never know when someone like Tokugawa will come again.
“Tokugawa?”

　I heard back the unfamiliar words that Mr. Dojima uttered.

"The Special Public Safety Commission ...... is the group you met when you left the dungeon. They usually don't help us with our work, but interfere only when it's uncomfortable. Next time I see you, I'll beat you to a pulp."

　Dojima-san said irritably.

"As long as they're under the protection of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they won't touch them. The question is how the foreigners will react. If we don't declare that we will not monopolize Lilicia's information at the earliest possible opportunity, they will try to force us to do something about it. In order for her to live a peaceful life, we'll keep her busy for a while."

　The lower the value of the information, the lower the risk of Lilicia and her companions being kidnapped. To that end, we will extract as much information as we can and make it public. It would be beneficial for the country if we could monopolize the information, but it would also put Lilicia in danger.      
　Considering safety, Dojima-san's decision was the right one.

"There are a lot of people who would object to us releasing the information we have for free. I have to work hard tomorrow to silence them. It's so annoying that we can't afford to fight with other countries right now. If you have a problem with that, go fight on the front lines yourself, or else sew your useless mouth shut."

　Dojima-san complained.     
　Dojima-san is a hard-nosed martial artist. He must not be good at taking care of such troublesome matters. How can he keep doing it, though? He doesn't say it out loud, but I can honestly respect that about him.

“...... and we're here. Let's get off."

　The limousine arrived at the Ministry of Magic, so we got out.     
　Well, I guess that's the end of my work for now.　I miss that cramped apartment since I haven't been home since I entered the dungeon.

"Is it okay for me to go home then?"      
"No. I have something I want you to see. Will you come inside?"     
"What do you want me to look at: ......?”

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

　I followed Dojima-san, wondering what it was all about.     
　It was a two-story building, and the awakened craftsmen are assembling it by hand, without using heavy machinery.

“Hm?　That guy is .......”

　At the construction site, I spot a familiar face.          
　He seems to have recognized me and approached me in a good mood.

“Hey Tanaka, thanks for your hard work. You did a great job this time, too."     
"Why is Adachi here?"     
"Why? It's just a greeting. We're members of the same company and guild now, aren't we?"

　My friend and colleague, Adachi, said in a playful tone

"And what is that building?　Is it something to do with you?"     
"What, you haven't heard? That building we are building now will be the office of the White Wolf Guild."     
"Ha......?”

　I was greatly baffled by the reply, which was so unexpected.      
　I'm sure we're looking for an office here in Tokyo, and the building looks spacious, so that's not a problem. But this is on the grounds of the Ministry of Magic.　I don't understand.

"I don't know what you mean. I heard that the elf princess doesn't want to leave you and is willing to cooperate with you if she can stay with you."     
"Eh..."     
"If that's the case, you can live in the Ministry of Magic. If you build an office, everything will be completed within this place. It's a perfect plan."      
"Eh? Ehhh?"     
"Oh, I told Yui about this and she's going to live here too. 
Living under one roof sounds like a romantic comedy."     
“Eh? Eehh? Eeehhh?”

　The sheer volume of information was enough to make my brain feel like it was going to explode.      
　I didn't hear that. I'm supposed to be the president of the company.

　I looked at Dojima-san to see what was going on, and he quickly looked away. That old man didn't tell me, did he?       
　When I try to approach him to question him, Lilicia came between us with an apologetic look on her face.

"I'm sorry, Tanaka!　I asked them to do this for me!　You may refuse if it bothers you!　So please don't blame Dojima-dono, okay?”

　Lilicia's eyes were bright as she appealed to me.      
　I'm weak when it's done this way. I'm annoyed that they did it on their own, but if they can make an office here, they won't have the media breaking in or someone messing with them. It's not so bad.

"...I understand. Let's do this for now until Lilicia gets used to this world. I don't know what we'll do after that. Is that okay?"      
"Of course I'm okay with that!　Thank you, Tanaka!

　Lilicia hugged me happily when I said that.
　I feel like Dojima-san is using me for his own good, but...well, I'm indebted to him so I'll close my eyes.

"Ah, that's right. Just as a formality, we have to have government personnel on guard duty, so we decided to let Amatsuki and Ayagawa live in the office as well."(Tl: This is just Beautiful)      
“Eh???"

　Dojima-san said something outrageous.      
　I take back what I said before. I can't let this old man do what he wants. I protested that I would be in big trouble,......, but it ended in vain.
