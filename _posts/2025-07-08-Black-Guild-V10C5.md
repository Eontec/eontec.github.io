Tl: Sam


…



The mysterious monster that appeared from the water.      
Unfamiliar with it, I took out my Labyrinth Analyzer from my pocket and pointed it at it. This device, which I received from Dojima-san, can identify a monster from the magic energy it emits and retrieve its information from a database.      
With a beep sound, the analysis finished, and text was displayed.      

It read:      
Cthulhu Rank: EX III
An evil god appearing in the Cthulhu Mythos.
Possesses extremely powerful mental contamination effects, capable of driving people to madness simply by being in its vicinity. In combat, it uses sharp claws and infinitely regenerating tentacles.
Its ecology, lifestyle, and thoughts are all shrouded in mystery, and it is said to be incompatible with humans.
Government Special Note: No previous sightings.<!--more-->

"So it's called Cthulhu. I feel like I've heard that name somewhere before."

The Cthulhu Mythos is the one where Riri and Dagosuke also appear, right?      
Many monsters resemble beings from various mythologies, but recently I feel like I've been encountering creatures from this particular mythos often. I wonder if there's some meaning to it.     

「Cthulhu's here!」      
「It's finally here」      
「I had a feeling with those green tentacles... lol」      
「Shachiken really has a connection to evil gods, huh?」      
「By the way, doesn't your head hurt? I feel sick...」      
「Be careful, it has a mental contamination effect. It's probably stronger than Shoggoth's or Deep One's」      
「D-Tube has countermeasures for mental contamination effects, but it's amazing that this thing can break through them」       
「I'm curious but I'm giving up on watching. So sad」      
「A cut-out with countermeasures will probably be uploaded later, watch that」      
「I feel so sick my stomach's about to flip, but I'm curious so I'll watch」      
「Don't do it lol」

"Something big has appeared. Is that the boss here?"

Dojima-san and the others approached.      
It seemed that the tentacles' attacks had stopped once Cthulhu emerged from the water. Cthulhu itself was staring at us with its large eyes.       
It seems to be observing our reaction.

"It seems so. Its rank is EX III, I think it's quite a formidable opponent."       
"Hah... troublesome, isn't it? If something of this class appeared on land, a country could be destroyed. We have to subjugate it here."

「Even an EX I rank Shoggoth has destroyed multiple large cities...」        
「Two ranks above that is insane, isn't it?」       
「Earth is in danger level」      
「Please, really defeat it!」      
「Since it's an evil god, it's technically a 'god,' right? Can a god be defeated?」
「What, we have Shachiken on our side」   
「Then we can do it」     
「If someone who doesn't know Shachiken saw this, they wouldn't understand the conversation, lol」      
「It's too scary, please really do something...!」      
「If Tanaka doesn't do it, who will!?」

"No doubt about it. That evil god is the cause of the magic energy circulation anomaly. If we defeat it, the monster disaster will not occur."

Dr. Nero, protected by Dojima-san, said.      
I don't know if it's true, but either way, we have no choice but to fight. I'll have Dojima-san protect the doctor, and Rin... she looks quite distressed. It seems she's being affected by the mental contamination.

"Are you alright, Rin?"      
"Yes... I'm alright. I can fight."

She said so, but her complexion was clearly poor. Her mental state was already unstable from hearing about the monster disaster. It's only natural for her not to be okay.

「It's tough even through the screen, so it must be hard for her」      
「In this regard, Shachiken and the Minister are the strange ones for being fine」      
「Tanaka's mind was forged by black company labor...」      
「Doesn't that just mean he stopped feeling anything?」      
「Exactly」      
「Does black company labor corrode the mind more than an evil god...?」      
「Black companies are still trash, after all」

"No, don't push yourself. The opponent is strong, not someone you can fight when you're not at your best. Protect the doctor with Dojima-san."       
"Sensei, but... kuh... no. Understood."

Rin showed a pained expression for a moment, then returned to her usual expression and obeyed.      

I know she wants to be helpful, and I appreciate that feeling, but I can't allow her to fight recklessly. Rin will only get stronger from now on; I can't let her fight impatiently and lose her here.

"Alright, then, shall we do this?"

I moved away from Rin and the others and stepped onto the water.         
Walking across the surface of the water with soft chap-chap sounds, I approached the evil god and looked up at its massive body.

"Thanks for waiting. I'm ready when you are."

『Lululu... Ooooh!』

The evil god let out a terrifying roar, then swung its right arm and punched me.        
It was a well-put punch with good hip rotation. I carefully assessed the blow and extended my right hand to receive it.        
A heavy thud reverberated through my body. As expected of something called a god, it had considerable power.       
Its pure arm strength probably surpassed that of the Demon Lord. Such a high-quality opponent is rarely encountered.          
I understand this is work... but I'm starting to enjoy it a little.
