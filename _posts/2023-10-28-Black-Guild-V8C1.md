Tl: Sam

…


"Hello everyone, It's me, Makoto Tanaka. Thank you for joining me for another stream today."

　I gave my usual greeting to the drone floating in the air and began the dungeon delivery.   
　Thanks in part to the advance notice, the number of viewers grew rapidly.

<div data-banner-id="424152"></div>

「He's here!」   
「I've been waiting for you.」   
「Oha Ken!」(Tl: Oha from "Ohayo" for good morning)   
「It's started!」   
<!--more-->
「I've been waiting for this since the day before yesterday!」   
「Is someone not with us this time?」

　I skimmed through the comments and took a few things from them that the viewers seemed to be wondering about.

"I'm not with any guests today. Well, Riri is here though."

　As I said that, Riri the Shoggoth came out of my breast pocket and looked at me with a "Ri?".   
　I'm always with her wherever I go, because it's too dangerous to leave her at home. I think it would be good if I could leave him with Adachi or something. ...... Well, if he can stand Riri's acid, that is.

<div id="container-aaae9f1061c7c37f010177a79ad54f13"></div>

「Riri!」   
「Cute!」   
「Shogo-tan hahaha!」   
「Is there a 1/1 figure yet?」   
「I want a Riri plushie!」   
「I want a life-size figure of Orca Ken, too.」   
「I wonder if it's too hard to get the goods individually...」   

　Riri's popularity was as great as ever, and the number of requests for merchandise was increasing day by day.   
　Adachi seemed to be aware of this, and is in contact with all parties involved in the project. However, there is still no timetable for the release of the product, so I couldn't say anything about it here.   
　As for the DX Shachiken Sword, they said they are almost ready to announce it, but I wonder if there are people who really want it at ....... If only the Hoshino family wants it, I'll cry stones.

　...... and yes. I was told by Adachi that I could report on that one. I'll tell him as soon as possible.

"Well, I have a report to make to you all, and I will make it before we dive into the dungeon."

「What?」   
「I'm so excited!」   
「No way. ......」   
「Marriage report?」   
「Who are you going to marry without me, Tanaka?」   
「I'm not ready to panic yet...」   
「You're so upset.」

"I've decided to create a new guild. And I, Makoto Tanaka, will be the president of the guild."

「What?」   
「Seriously?」   
「Congratulations!」   
「Just creating a new guild is a surprise, and you're the president?」   
「This is a great announcement!」   
「I thought you were getting married....... (´・ω・｀)」   
「From now on, you'll be the president Kensei, not the corporate Kensei.」   
「So it's Shachiken for short.」   
「It's still the same.」
「Shachoken is cute too, isn't he?」(Tl: The Japanese for President Kensei, oh and just in case you don’t notice, Kensei means sword saint, so sometimes I might use that, anyways, “社長”, the kainji for president is read “Shacho”)
「Tanaka, who used to have eyes like a dead fish, has grown up. ...... (smiling)」
「Don't be a Kouhokareshizura」(Tl: Couldn’t think of any translation close enough."Kouhokareshizura" is a term used to refer to fans who quietly cheer from the back of an idol's concert venue, rather than cheering in the front. Rather than getting excited and raising his voice, he maintains a calm demeanour, folding his arms and nodding at the performance.)

　The reaction to the announcement of the new guild was positive.
　Everyone was surprised and congratulated me. Thank God, it seems my fears were unfounded that someone like me might get flack for saying I was going to be president.

「But if you become president, won't you be unable to distribute or something?」   
「Sure. I'd miss that.」   
「I mean, do you have any other employees?」   
「What's the name of the guild!」   
「Do you have any plans to recruit employees?」  
「Are you looking for a mistress?」(Tl: I so miss translating this guy's live chat)    

　The questions came one after the other.   
　I'll ignore the last one for now, but I'll try to answer them one by one.

"I'm going to take the position of president, but I'm not going to change the content of my activities. Rest assured that I will continue to stream. There are two employees at the moment, myself and a friend, and we have no plans to recruit at this time. But we may recruit if we need to in the future."

「Understood.」   
「I see.」   
「You'll keep streaming. Good.」   
「I'm so relieved!」   
「I'll have nothing to live for if you stop streaming Shachiken!」   
「I wonder if your friend is doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work.　He seems to be a good producer.」   
「I guess I'll just have to wait unemployed until they start recruiting.」   
「If you put out a job offer, I'm sure you'll get a lot of people.」

"...... Oh, yes, that's right. Hoshino, who has often appeared in our collaborations, will be hired on a part-time basis. I don't know if we will officially hire her as an employee, but she is willing to help us.」

「What!　Yui is here?」   
「Well, it's a reasonable choice.」   
「You're hiring a mistress?」   
「I knew she was the main heroine.......」(Tl: Tch... Lies)   
「Part-time job, I didn't know that was an option.」   
「Well, it makes more sense than hiring someone you don't know.」   
「Even the most die-hard fans were silent at this.」   
「It's a mistress!」

"And, er...... this will be the new guild Emblem."

　I navigated my phone and brought up a single image on the delivery screen.   
　It was a logo of a white wolf holding a broken collar in its mouth. Adachi had a professional make it for us, and it's pretty cool. I like it too.   

「That's cool.」   
「I'm getting fired up」   .
「The guild Emblem is the symbol of the guild, so it's important」.   
「Is this a wolf instead of a dog ......?　It looks a little bit like the Black Dog Guild's black dog.」   
「By the way, that guild's mark had a rugged collar attached to it with a hard-looking chain.」   
「So he's evolved into a wolf by breaking his collar.」   
「So the collar is a metaphor for Suda.」

"The guild's name is the 『 White Wolf Guild. 』 The 『Black Dog Guild 』 that I was in was an incredibly dark guild, as you all know. In the new guild, we aim to be a white guild where everyone can work happily. That is why we decided on this name. We have a full benefits package, bonuses based on performance, various allowances, and a flextime system. And of course, enough holidays. The White Wolf Guild will strive to be a guild that everyone will want to join."

「Oh, that's a lot of enthusiasm.」   
「It's a white guild, isn't it?」   
「I want to join just because Tanaka is here.」   
「It looks like a lot of work, but I wish you all the best.」   
「It's not as bad as the Black Dog Black Dog Guild, but there are still black guilds out there.」   
「A new wind is blowing in the industry.」   
「I'm rooting for you.」

　Having said everything I had planned to say, I heaved a sigh.   
　We now had five million viewers, many of whom were foreigners. That's enough publicity for both domestic and international audiences.   
　But the real work began from here. The dungeon I would dive today is a special dungeon, different from the usual dungeons.

"Now that the announcement is over, let's get down to business. Here is the dungeon we will dive today."

　The drone changed its angle to show the dungeon I was going to dive.   
　Until now, the viewers could not see where I was because I was against the wall. But when they saw it on the screen, they understood where I was all at once.

「This is ......!」   
「I've been waiting for this since the announcement!」   
「Really?　You can see inside!」   
「I've been wondering about this for a long time!」   

　What appeared on the delivery screen was a huge tree.   
　The tree, tall enough to reach the clouds and thick enough to be a building, is a dungeon in itself.   

　The 『Yoyogi World Tree Dungeon』.   
　It was a recently built dungeon whose internal structure was still unknown.   
　Dojima-san had previously asked me to investigate this dungeon, and today I finally got to dive in.   
　The government had already completed the investigation of the upper part of the dungeon, which is exposed from the ground, but the underground root part has not been progressed due to many powerful monsters. Today we would Stream the investigation of that part of the Dungeon.

"I will now begin my business work. Please, everyone, stay with me until the end."

　After putting my tie back on, I dived into the dungeon, where no one had yet ventured.


....

Tl Note: I've corrected the Volume numbers with this release, I'll try to get everything rectified on Novel Updates. Quite an inconvenience
