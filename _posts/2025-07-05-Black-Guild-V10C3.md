"The density of muscle fibers is extremely high... The magic energy content of the cells and bone density also show abnormal values. Even Ogre-kin and Dragon-kin don't have these values, yet a normal human... Interesting! Fufufu, what kind of environment does one have to live in to become like this? Extremely fascinating."

Dr. Nero muttered to himself, observing my body with a magnifying glass-like tool and touching me.      
He had completely entered research mode. Once he's like this, he probably won't stop easily.

「As expected, Shachiken is strange even by otherworld standards」      
「If you work at a black company, this is what happens to you」       
「If you can endure it, that is...」       
「Even in other worlds, there aren't people who work this much, huh?」       
「I want to examine Tanaka's body too, thoroughly」       
「Officer, over here」      
「He casually surpasses Ogre-kin and Dragon-kin, lol」

"To think such a unique being would be born in only about 10 years since the dungeon appeared. Ah... how wonderful...!"        
"Um, excuse me. Are you done?"

If he continued observing me like this, I felt like he'd strip all my clothes off.<!--more-->       
Rin was sending me a gaze mixed with jealousy and excitement, and I felt it would be bad to let this continue.        
I heard that D-Tube is strict about sexual content. I definitely don't want my account banned for something like this.

"Ah, my apologies. I got excited without thinking."       
"No, it's fine, but... is my body really that strange?"      
"Strange is an understatement! Your body is truly superb, fantastic! It's normally impossible to contain such power within a fragile human body. If one were to force it, the body would be unable to withstand it and would break. However, your body has evolved to be sturdy enough to withstand that energy. It's unbelievable that you could evolve this far despite originally being a normal human! One could even call it artistic! If only I had the time, I'd want to examine it thoroughly..."

Dr. Nero directed a sticky gaze at me.       
Ugh, I shivered. I don't even want to think about what kind of experiments he intends to do. This person is definitely a mad scientist.  

「He's being targeted again」        
「So popular, huh?」       
「You light novel protagonist!」      
「I'm not jealous at all, though... lol」       
「Rin-chan is jealous, so cute」       
「By the way, why is Shachiken really this strong lol Even the otherworlders are confused about it lol」     
「I want him to publish the test results」

"Um, already..."      
"Wait a little longer, I'm just collecting samples... munch"

As I was wondering how to pull him off, Dojima-san grabbed the back of the doctor's neck and lifted him up. I was saved, but that's no way to treat an important person.

"Come on, let's go. The magic energy is getting quite dense, the lowest level must be near now."      
"Yes... you're right."      

The amount of magic energy I felt from below was clearly immense.       
It was equivalent to or even greater than that of the Yoyogi World Tree Dungeon.       
We descended further into the dungeon, maintaining our caution.


◇　◇　◇


After that, we continued to advance through the dungeon without any major troubles, despite being attacked by monsters.       
Besides the Flying Sharks, unique sharks like Cyclone Sharks, which create tornadoes, and Sharkberus, a three-headed shark, attacked us, but we defeated them all and moved on.

"We're almost at the lowest level. Be careful... urp."

Dr. Nero said, retching.      
He must be quite exhausted, yet he followed us this far without a single complaint. He's surprisingly gutsy. Or perhaps his intellectual curiosity outweighs his discomfort. Either way, it helped us.

"...Here."

Having passed through a narrow passage, I slowed down.     
It was a very open space. It was like a giant underground lake, with water filling the ground.        
The water seemed very deep, and the bottom was not visible. And there were scattered landmasses on the water. The landmasses weren't connected, but they were close enough to jump across.

"There's nothing here."       
"Yeah, but we should still be careful."

At the deepest part of a dungeon, there is always a boss.      
There are no exceptions to this. Even if it's not in front of us now, the boss must be somewhere.         
Paying attention to our surroundings, we advanced by jumping across the landmasses.       
And we arrived at a larger landmass in the center of the underground lake.

"Hmm, nothing's coming out."          
"We feel strong magic energy, but it's diffused throughout the space, so we can't pinpoint it."

Dojima-san and I looked around.       
However, we couldn't find any monsters, let alone the boss. What should we do?

"It seems it's not on land. In that case..."

Dojima-san's eyes turned towards the underground lake spreading beneath our feet.       
Well, that's how it would be. The boss of a dungeon that exists underwater would be an aquatic monster.

"Then I'll go first. Dojima-san and Rin, stay with the doctor..."

Just as I was about to change into my swimsuit again, there was a sudden splash! sound, and something leaped out of the water.      
It was dozens of long, slender green things... They wriggled unpleasantly. They looked like squid or octopus legs... or some kind of tentacles.        
Is this the boss here...? What on earth is this thing?(Tl: This is definitely time for Riri to shine, I can see it)
