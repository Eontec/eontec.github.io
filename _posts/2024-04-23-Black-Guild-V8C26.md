"They're tough. 
You can go ahead and kill them."

　When I heard this, three of his men took up positions around me.    
　Each of them has a dagger, a sickle, and a spear in his hand.

"They look like ninjas. ......"      
I am sure you are right. Our ancestors were the ["Oniwabanshu"]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oniwaban ) who served the Shogunate. Their mission was to protect this country from behind the scenes. The times may change, but the spirit remains the same.

　Wow, I didn't realize they really were NINJA.    
　The foreign viewers would have gone crazy if they had been on the delivery. The delivery must have stopped because they must have jammed it in some way. So the modern NINJA can use high technology too.

"---- Ha!"

　As I was thinking this, a man with a dagger came slashing at me at high speed.     
　The man's unique gait made it difficult to sense his distance. But at this speed, I could catch him without being deceived.

"Yo!"

　Seeing through the dagger's trajectory, I drew back until the very last second before evading. Then, I grabbed the wrist of the opponent who was held out in front of me with one hand.

"What?"     
"It's going to hurt a little bit. Prepare yourself."

　Then, using the opponent's strength, I threw him to the ground with a circular motion.      
　Tachibana-style jujutsu, 《Kazaguruma》      
　Tachibana-style is famous for swordsmanship, but it also includes techniques other than swordsmanship. 
It is said that in ancient times during battles, Tachibana-style swordsmen were told not to let their guard down even if they lost their weapons. That's really scary.

"Gah ......?"

　The man who was slammed into the ground let out a cry and lost consciousness.     
　There is a big crack in the ground where he was hit. It seems he didn't catch himself well. When I was training with my master, she would keep throwing attacks at me until I was good at receiving them, I remember that fondly.

"Ku......."

　The government men stared at me with their weapons at the ready.       
　Apparently, they thought I couldn't put up much of a fight. Or did they think I was tired from being in the dungeon for so long?　Well, I'm certainly tired from all the overtime mode I've used. But...

"I can't guarantee that I will be able to ...... successfully take it easy on you. I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get a good deal on it."

　I released magical energy from my body to intimidates them.      
　However, the opponent charged straight at me, as if they doesn't care for their lives. 

"This is difficult" 

　If I could, I wouldn't want to slash humans too much. 
Even if the other party is from the government, it is even more so.     
　I decided to fight with my bare hands, not with a sword.

"Ha!"

　The two opponents pinched each other and attacked me.     
　The spear and the [kusarigama]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusarigama) are well-coordinated. The trajectory of the kurarigama is particularly difficult to read, so an ordinary person would be confused.     
　However, if you look closely at the opponent's hand, it is surprisingly not difficult to read the trajectory. I read through the trajectory of the chain scythe and grabbed the weight coming toward me with a snap.

"What?"    
"Yo...tsu."

　As I pulled the weight I caught, the other man's feet left the ground and flew toward me. It seems he didn't let go in time.    
　This is lucky. I lightly jabbed him in the body as he flew toward me.

"Migyu!"

　The guy made a sound like a squashed frog, and fell to his knees.      
　Okay, one more to go.

"You ......!"

　The man thrust out his spear and attacked.     
　I catch the blow with my abdominal muscles, since I can't be bothered to avoid it. Okay, I managed to squeeze it in.

"The spear won't move. ......?"(Tl: bro was shook to his core)

　While the opponent was puzzled, I slice off the tip of the spear with my hand.     
　Then, I firmly grasp the neck of the man who is holding just a stick with my right hand. The guy tries to let go of the stick and force my hand off, but I'm putting so much force into it that I can't get it off.   

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

　Okay, that's it, I'm in control.    
　I look at him and speak,

"I win, Isosumi-san. If you continue, your life will be in danger. Please retreat."     
"I didn't expect him to be this strong. I knew it from the video, but seeing it in person is overwhelming. It's amazing."      
"?"

　Isosumi was surprised, but not panicked.      
　Do I have to threaten him a little harder?

"I am sorry, but such negotiations will not work with us. We have already given our lives to our country."    
"What are you talking ...... about?"

　The guy who was holding my neck suddenly pulled out a knife from somewhere and slashed at me.      
　How could he resist in a situation like this? I immediately thrust the index finger of the hand I was holding into his neck.

"Gu... ah......."

　Then the man drooped down and lost consciousness.     
　Tachibana-ryu jujutsu, ikishime-doshi. This is a technique in which a finger is inserted into the opponent's neck to block the airway and knock him out. The man's neck is almost killed when he tightens his neck as hard as he can.

"...... It is a tremendous power. Even if we were a bunch, we wouldn't be able to beat you. But can you 'protect' the people behind you without 'killing' us as we come towards you with all our might?"

　As Isosumi said this, about ten men in suits appeared at high speed.     
　Ugh. It seems that he had more friends with him than I had expected.

　To be honest, I could afford to just protect them even now when I'm tired. However, if I want to protect them and take on that many people, I'll have to exert a certain amount of strength.    
　But if I exerted myself, I might kill them. It would be easier if we were dealing with monsters,.......

"Then, please give up the idea."

　The subordinates of Isosumi prepared their respective weapons.     
　I have no choice but to do it. The next moment I made up my mind,

"That's enough. Hold your blades."

　A dignified voice echoed through the dungeon.     
　Then, a second after the voice, there was a pitter-patter!　The ground was covered with a thick layer of ice. The men's feet are immersed in ice and they are unable to move.    
This magic is from .......

"It looks like I made it just in time."

　A woman appeared, saying so.      
　When Isosumi saw this, he spoke her name while clicking his teeth.

"Amatsuki, Kanade ......!"     
"The Minister of the Ministry of Demon Control, Ryuichiro Dojima, has entrusted this place to me. I will not allow any further acts of combat or protection against his will."

　The most dependable childhood friend of mine in the world said so resolutely.


........

Tl Note: You can't make this stuff up(I mean, the author did, so I guess you can). Amatsuki(Best girl) arrives. Will she fight? or just de-escalate the situation. I feel she's pretty OP tho.     
And yeah, I'm somewhat back, I'm home for holiday and I'm using my mom's laptop. After a lot of trying, my laptop couldn't be fixed. Howerver, I should probably be able to buy a new one early next week.    
I'm pretty busy with some work, so releases might not be stable, but I'm back
