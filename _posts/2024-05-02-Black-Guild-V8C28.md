Tl: Sam


…



　After we safely exited the dungeon, we were greeted by a large number of people.       
　The amount of people waiting for us to leave the dungeon is always great, but today it was even greater. Dozens of awakened guards were holding them back, but it looked like it was going to collapse at any moment.      
　
Well, today there are two otherworldly people and the delivery got cut off in the middle. I guess people who were curious came rushing in.

"Hey!　Shachiken's coming out!”       
"Seriously?　Welcome back!"     
"I've been waiting for you!"      
“Shachiken is the best! Shachiken is the best!" 

　The ground shook with cheers.     
　It's so intense. Am I a popular artist?

“Oh, hey, Tanaka. There are a lot of people here......."     
“Don't worry. They won't attack you."(Tl: You know you've made it when people look at you over a literal otherworlder) 

　Lilicia was scared, hiding behind my back. I've never seen so many people in my life.      

　Incidentally, Dagosuuke is wearing my suit jacket over his head because ordinary people would be mentally tainted if they look directly at him. It seemed to be effective, and I haven't seen anyone who has gone crazy.

"Lilicia-tan!　Look at me!"      
"Elf ha ha ha!"    
"Make me a subject too!"

　People who saw Lilicia shouted loudly, their eyes glazed over.        
　When she saw this, she lets out a small “hic!” and hides completely behind me. She's totally freaked out, like a ...... borrowed cat.

　The men's wild cheers grew even stronger as they were amused by the sight of her. I'm in trouble.

"Don't flirt, get in the car. The guards won't hold it any longer.”

　Amatsuki says with a hint of grumpiness in her voice.      
　It was a force majeure.      
　I protested in my mind as I tried to get into the car,

"I was about to get into the car when he said, A college student and then an elf. I didn't think you'd be so carefree and unprincipled."

　She gave me a sarcastic look from behind.
　I feel like Amatsuki's impression of me is getting worse and worse. I hope I can make up for it somewhere.

"What is this iron box, brother?　It's a strange shape for a carriage."      
“Oh, this chair is so soft ......!　It started shaking, Tanaka!　What's going on?"

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

　The two otherworlders were having fun with their first reactions to the car. Apparently, science hasn't developed in the other world.          
　The two of them were reacting as if they were time slips from the past, I closed my eyes in the car and took a rest for the first time in a long time.

◇　◇　◇

　We escaped from the dungeon and arrived at the Ministry of Magic, but we were busy after that.       
　First of all, we carefully inspected Lilithia and Dago. They were not born in the dungeon. There is a possibility that they may have unknown viruses or pathogens.      
　So they were carefully inspected, but for the time being, it seems that nothing harmful to humans was found. I thought I could go home if that was the case ......, but that was not allowed.

　Not only Lilicia, but even Dago, who is a great help to me, cried to me and asked me not to go back home.      
　I was weak. I had no choice but to take a shower at the Ministry of Monster Control and slept on the bed in the guest room of the Ministry of Monster Control.

"Huh... I'm sleepy"

　I slept in a bed that was softer than usual, and I got up, stretching.      
　Thanks to a good night's sleep, I felt less tired. I could dive into the dungeon right now. I wouldn't do it, though.

　I washed my face and checked my phone while changing into my suit.     
　The news sites and social networking sites were all talking about us. It seemed that Lilicia in particular was being reported all over the world.     
Every country would love to hear from her. Is it any wonder that the bigwigs got impatient and decided to take aggressive measures?

　As I was thinking in a daze, the door was suddenly opened with a bang!　The door was opened with a bang.

“Oh, you're awake, Tanaka!　Thanks for your hard work this time!"     
"Dojima-san!"

　It was Dojima-san, the minister of the Ministry of Monster Control, who entered the door with a voice so loud that my eardrums went numb. It is normal for Dojima-san to be here since he is in the Ministry of Magic, but I was surprised to see his face first thing in the morning. He is very impressive.

“Well, I'm sorry it took me so long to get here!　I've been putting in a lot of groundwork and it's been all night!”

　Dojima-san laughed it off.     
　I'm sure he was solving problems that arose in the process of protecting Lilicia and the others. Judging by the way his suit looked, he was working without sleeping. The fact that he never looked tired is a testament to his hard work.

"I'm sorry to wake you up so early, but I'm going to have to ask you to stay up with me a little while longer. The elf girl says she won't go out unless you follow her."     
“......, I understand.”

　It looks like I'm confirmed to go, so I'll give up my futile defiance.       
　Since I picked her up, I have to take care of her. I'll just go home and sleep anyway.

"So where are you going?　Shouldn't you not go out too much?"      
"First, I'm going to the Bureau of Magical Research to conduct an additional examination of the two. After that, I'm going to the prime minister's office to talk with the prime minister, and then I'm going to get Lilicia-dono to shoot a video for the media. Ha, this is going to be fun!"    
"Yeah, ...... totally.”

　Fed up with the horribly packed schedule, I left the room with Mr. Dojima.
