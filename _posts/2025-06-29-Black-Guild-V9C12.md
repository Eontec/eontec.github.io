Tl: Sam

…


"It's surprisingly normal inside..."

I muttered, looking around.        
The ground was sand, but everything else was bare rock. It was no different from a dungeon on land.

「It's kinda normal」       
「By the way, can they breathe here lol?」       
「The fact that this is the seabed is too scary. I definitely couldn't go there」       
「Well, you can't go (physically), so it's fine, right?」        
「It suddenly turned into a regular stream lol」        
「I really don't want to have to swim back home」

I tried breathing, but felt no difficulty at all; it seemed there was normal air despite being underwater. The brightness was also fine, allowing me to see far ahead without issue.        
In other words, it was an environment perfectly fine for human activity. It was so comfortable it almost felt like we were invited.

"Rii?"

As I was thinking such things, Riri poked her head out from my suit's chest pocket.       
When I stroked Riri's head with my fingertip as she looked around, wondering where she was, Riri chirped "Rii~♪" happily.

「Riri-chan's here!」      
「I've been waiting」      
「Today's screenshot time」       
「Ia! Ia! (A string of words causing nausea)」         
「The Evil God is happy too」       
「Squishy Riri-tan」      
「Look this way!」     
「Your eyes are cute!」       
「I'm buying 10,000 gacha Riri-chan figures that are coming out next time」          
「Adachi! More Riri-chan merchandise, please? (Begging)」         
「They're increasing, but still not enough, right?」        
「You can never have too much of these」

When Riri appeared, the comment flow accelerated even further. Her popularity was still incredible.         
I brought Riri along as usual, but this time I decided to have her stay quiet in my pocket.          
Last time, in the Yoyogi World Tree Dungeon, I was alone, so it was fine for her to participate in combat, but this time Dojima-san and Rin are with me.          
Riri's acid is quite powerful, so there's a risk of serious injury if it hits someone. Thanks to our special training, her aim has become more accurate, but there's no need to take unnecessary risks.         
Though Dojima-san might be fine even if he gets hit.

"Hey Tanaka! I lost this time, but I won't lose next time! If only that fish hadn't been there, then---"         
"Yes, yes, I understand. I'm an adult, so I'll agree with you on that."         
"What was that, let me finish!"

「Minister furious, lol」       
「Both are super popular but act like children lol」        
「What are these people doing in a dangerous dungeon...?」        
「No sense of tension lol」      
「But that brings a sense of security lol」     
「Hurry up and move forward」

Ignoring the fuming Dojima-san, I averted my gaze and saw Rin examining the waterline at the dungeon's entrance. I wonder what she's doing.

"What's wrong, Rin?"       
"No, it's just that there are some marks on this sand."

Looking closer, there indeed seemed to be marks of something large and flat moving across the sand. The marks continued into the water. It looked like a large creature had moved between land and water.

"Did a monster come out? It doesn't look like a monster disaster is happening."

When a monster disaster occurs and monsters emerge from a dungeon, a unique type of magic energy is emitted. Having dived into the Imperial Palace Underground Dungeon, I had naturally experienced it.        
But from this dungeon, I don't feel that peculiar, unpleasant magic energy.

"Hmm. Perhaps it tried to get out once and then gave up."

Dojima-san, who had approached without me noticing, speculated. Indeed, that would make sense.       
However... if that speculation is correct, it would be bad.

"If so, isn't that bad? Monsters wanting to get out is a precursor to a monster disaster."        
"Indeed. It might have been the right decision to act quickly."

The great disaster, the 'Great Imperial Palace Monster Disaster,' which caused tens of thousands of casualties.        
The same phenomenon must have occurred before that happened. If a monster disaster were to occur in this dungeon as well, hundreds, or even more monsters, would be unleashed into the ocean.        
If that were to happen, it would be virtually impossible to subjugate all of them.

「Seriously?」      
「That's bad, isn't it?」      
「Tokyo has too many dangerous dungeons」      
「I was a victim, and I never want to experience that again...」      
「Please do something, Shachiken!」       
「Seriously, please do something, I beg you」        
「The future of this country truly rests on Tanaka's shoulders」

Many anxious comments mixed in.        
It was understandable; that disaster was too horrific. It's a miracle that they managed to recover.

"Alright, then let's hurry to the back... huh?"

Suddenly, I looked at Rin, and she was frozen, looking down.          
Her face was pale, and her body was trembling slightly.

"Are you okay, Rin?"       
"Y-yes... I'm okay."

Rin replied, but she was clearly not okay.        
She must have remembered the past when she heard about the monster disaster. Rin was an orphan of the monster disaster, having lost both parents in the Great Imperial Palace Monster Disaster. She knew its horror better than anyone.       
She must be terrified at the thought of it happening again.

"Rin, you don't have to force yourself. It's okay to turn back."          
"No, really... I'm okay. If a monster disaster truly occurs, I can't run away. I joined the Ministry of Monster Control precisely to prevent it from happening again."

Rin looked directly into my eyes and said forcefully.        
Once she's like this, nothing I say will make her turn back. It seems I have no choice but to give in.

"Alright. But if it really seems impossible, I'll knock you out and send you back."         
"Yes, thank you... Sensei."

With Rin, whose complexion had improved slightly, I went over to Dojima-san. Then,

"Oh Tanaka, it seems we have an early welcome party."           
"Eh?"

Prompted by Dojima-san, I looked towards the path leading deeper into the dungeon, and there were about twenty 'Fish-men' glaring at us. All of them were baring their fangs and looking at us.           
Unlike Dagosuke, they didn't feel out of place. It seemed they were ordinary Fish-men.

"If they're monsters, I can cut them down without hesitation. Shall we do it?"

We each readied our weapons and charged into the horde of Fish-men.
