"Fishing in a dungeon...? Is such a thing possible?"

As I was preparing for fishing, Rin asked, looking puzzled.          
Ah, right, normal explorers don't fish. And few people would intentionally want to fight a monster that's in the water.

「Indeed, I've never seen a dungeon stream where they're fishing」        
「You can't buy a fishing rod that catches monsters lol」        
「Maybe he'll catch a water dragon or something」          
「Fishing is an idea that only comes up if you view the opponent as food lol」            
「Monsters are food」             
「Um, eating monsters is a lie, right...?」          
「First-timer-kun is also confused」                  
「Well, I also freaked out when I was a first-timer, so it's understandable lol<!--more-->」

"Basically, dungeon monsters don't attack each other. But if an opponent is weakened, it's different. They might prey on that monster to replenish their magic energy. So, if you weaken the monster that's going to be bait, you can catch it."                  
"I see..."

If you fish, you can sometimes encounter rare monsters you wouldn't normally meet.          
I'm also happy to eat flavors I haven't tasted before, and above all, the act of fishing itself is fun. I might even make it a hobby after I quit my job.

"Fishing is great. Unlike fighting monsters, it's good because you can't just brute force your way through. When you concentrate, endure, and then reel in a big one all at once, it feels incredibly satisfying."          
"Is that so...? I'd like to try it sometime too."           
"Wouldn't that be nice? We don't have time to do it leisurely today, but how about I teach you on our next day off?"           
"---!?"

Rin flinched, trembling in surprise.         
Huh, did she dislike it?

"No, you don't have to come if you don't want to, of course. Rin must be busy too."          
"No, I'm coming. Absolutely."            
"O-oh, I see."

She pressed me so eagerly that I recoiled.          
What is this pressure? I still can't fully understand what Rin is thinking.

「He casually made a date promise lol」        
「A fishing date sounds good, please stream it」           
「The image of Rin-chan happily watching Shachiken fishing happily right beside him popped into my head」             
「That's nice」                 
「Riajuu explode!」           
「The explosion doesn't work, as usual」           
「Even if they exploded, these two would probably keep fishing lol」          
「This couple is too strong...」 

"Next is the bait. I'll hook this one I just caught."            
"Hmph!"

Rin gasped when she saw what I held up.                
The bait I chose was a 'Dungeon Worm' that I caught when I briefly stepped away. This monster, which looks like a giant earthworm, usually lives under rocks or in the soil.              
Its strength is the weakest, E-rank, just like a slime.            
If it senses danger, it might shoot corrosive fluid from its tip, but it's slow and weak.            
It's strong enough that even a non-Awakened person could defeat it with a firearm.

「Gross!」          
「Heee!」          
「Ugh---!」       
「Gore warning」         
「It's still alive. It's wriggling so much」            
「Rin-chan, frozen in place, is cute」       
「Is she bad with insects?」       
「Well, there are probably fewer people who are okay with a giant earthworm like this lol」           
「Indeed」        
「Shachiken holding it with his bare hands is abnormal」           
「Ah, the Minister is also putting a Dungeon Worm on his hook」         
「That person probably isn't scared of earthworms either lol」

Dojima-san and I finished putting the Dungeon Worms on our fishing rods.           
The trick is to keep them alive, not completely kill them. If they die, they just become materials.

"Alright, I'll go first. Hmph!"

Dojima-san boldly cast the hook with the Dungeon Worm.         
The hook flew vigorously and landed in the water.        
He's good, even though this is his first time fishing in a dungeon.         

"When I was young, I often fished in rivers, how nostalgic."

Dojima-san skillfully operated the fishing rod.        
I wasn't planning on competing, but I can't show a pathetic sight in front of Rin. I'll catch a big one and show her something cool.
