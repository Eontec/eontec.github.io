…



"Here! I even prepared a marriage registration form! Sign it!"   
"I told you I wouldn't! Let go!"     

I forcefully pushed away the Princess who was relentlessly trying to marry me.     
Seriously, where did she even learn about marriage registration forms? I suspect Adachi or some viewers told her unnecessary things…     

"Hmph! Isn't this fine? I'm asking you so earnestly! How stingy!"   

Lilicia whined. When she's in public, she acts like a dignified princess, but in the office, she's like a big child. She's completely recognized this place as her own home.       
That in itself makes me happy. It would be pitiful if she felt lonely and anxious ever since coming from another world.       
However... dealing with her is not easy.     
If I were to say something like this on a stream or social media, her fans would probably go wild with jealousy and burn me at the stake.      

"Why won't you marry me, Tanaka!"      
"I've told you many times, haven't I? You and I just met. It’s too soon to get married. Besides, you don't even have a nationality yet. The city office wouldn't accept the marriage registration form even if you wrote it."<!--more-->

I said, pointing at the marriage registration form she held.     
In the name field, "Lilicia" was written in a clumsy hand. It seems she's still studying to write.

"Guh-nunu, I'm not giving up yet!"     
"Please, just give up a little..."     

I answered, placing Riri the Shoggoth, who had been quietly in my pocket, onto the table.      
I'm a man too. There's no way I wouldn't be happy to be proposed to by a beautiful woman like Lilicia. I know she's a good person, and living together with her has fostered affection.      
But that doesn't mean I can just say, "Yes, I'll marry you."      
The circumstances surrounding us are too complex. And Lilicia might just be confused by the situation. If she could return to her original world, I don't know if her feelings would be the same then.       
I can't accept a proposal that might just be a momentary lapse of judgment. 

"Lilicia-chan. You shouldn't bother Tanaka-san too much."      
"Ugh... Even Hoshino..."     
"Haha, I'm rooting for you, Princess. If you marry the Princess, it'll add even more prestige to Big Bro."    

Dagosuke tried to console her, but Lilicia remained dejected.     
It's pitiful, but I still can't marry her. It would be rude to Lilicia if I decided to marry her for such a reason.     

"Well, preparations are complete, so let's eat! I put all my effort into cooking today!"

When Hoshino said that, Lilicia and Dagosuke took their seats. Riri, on the table, also went to her own dish.     
On the table was a meal that had been carefully balanced nutritionally. Hoshino's cooking skills were excellent, and Lilicia and Dagosuke had completely fallen in love with her food.     

"Hehe, Big Sis's cooking looks delicious again today. Let's eat!"      
"Nuwah!? Hey Dagosuke, I was going to eat that!"    
"Lilicia-chan, don't worry, there's still more!"     

Everyone noisily enjoyed their meal. Lilicia still couldn't use chopsticks well, so she was using a fork, but Dagosuke, surprisingly, used chopsticks skillfully.      
I've gotten used to this sight recently.      
I was a little worried if the two people from another world would like our food, but that was completely unfounded. Hoshino often cooks for us in place of Amatsuki and Rin, who are busy with work, and the two always eat it deliciously.     
A big reason why the two listen to Hoshino so well is probably because she's captured their stomachs. Well, I'm one of them too, so I can't really say much about them.      

"Ah, Tanaka-san. Could you get the TV remote control?"     
"I'll turn it on. News is fine, right?"

I replied to Hoshino and picked up the remote control on the table, pressing a button.      
Then a screen appeared in the air, and the news began to play. Thanks to Adachi's negotiations, the office now had the latest aerial projection machine. The picture quality was quite good, so I sometimes enjoyed movies at home on my days off. Life here was comfortable.

<div data-nat="424166"></div>
"---Following Ueno last week, a new dungeon has appeared in Akihabara today. Four new dungeons have been born this week. The frequency of dungeon appearances is increasing not only in Japan but also overseas, and anxiety is spreading." 

On the TV screen, the announcer was seriously reading the news.       
Another new dungeon, huh? I probably won't run out of work, but it's unsettling how quickly they're increasing. If dungeons increase, the probability of monster disasters also increases. And Amatsuki and the others won't be able to come home as often. I wish they'd take it easy.     

"Wow, this TV thing is convenient, isn't it? There was something similar where I used to live, but only a few high-ranking people could use it."       
"Elves and humans didn't have anything similar. If I could return to that world, I'd definitely like to try and replicate it."

Dagosuke and Lilicia said, stuffing food into their mouths like hamsters.      
Both of them were completely engrossed in this world's culture and were constantly on their smartphones whenever they had free time. There's a concern about whether it's okay to transmit this world's technology to theirs... but well, since we don't know the means of travel between worlds yet, it's meaningless to think about it.       
This world also benefits from dungeons, I thought, as I watched the TV.

"---Breaking news. A special escort vehicle traveling in Tokyo earlier was attacked by unknown assailants, and the special prisoner being escorted has reportedly escaped."        
"...What did you say?"

My brows furrowed at the dangerous news that entered my ears.      
A special prisoner meant an 'Awakened' person who had committed a crime and was being punished.     
Awakened people who could defeat monsters naturally couldn't be held in ordinary prisons. If they were, they'd just break their handcuffs and walls and escape.      
That's why Awakened criminals were put into special containment facilities designed for them... but it seems one had escaped on the way.       
A special escort vehicle transporting an Awakened person should have Awakened guards, so how on earth did they overpower them and let the prisoner escape? 

"Tanaka-san..."      
"It's fine. Even if it's in Tokyo, it's not near here, so this place should be safe."

I reassured Hoshino, who looked anxious.     
Our office was within the Ministry of Monster Countermeasures' premises. Only a complete idiot would try to attack this place.     
Still, I hoped they'd catch him soon. Who on earth escaped?

"---The one who escaped from the special escort vehicle is Suda Akihiro, the former president of the Black Dog Guild. He is also known as the former boss of Makoto Tanaka, a currently active streamer."       
"...Eh?"

An unexpected name entered my ears, and I froze.      
I saw Hoshino also widened her eyes in shock. Lilicia and Dagosuke, who knew nothing, just looked bewildered.

"Hey Tanaka, your name was just called on TV. You're popular, aren't you?"       
"As expected of Big Bro! You're a man of the moment!"

The two, not understanding the meaning, said such carefree things.        
I sent a glance to Hoshino, who was the only one besides me who understood the situation.      

"Tanaka-san, this Suda person is---"      
"Ah, it looks like things are going to get troublesome..."

I sighed, looking at the face of my former boss on the TV, a face I had thought I would never see again.
