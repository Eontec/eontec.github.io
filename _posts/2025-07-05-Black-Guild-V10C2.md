"What do you mean a monster disaster will occur!? Tell me!"      
"W-wait a minute..."

Rin grabbed Dr. Nero by the collar, desperately questioning him.      
At this rate, the doctor would be strangled and lose consciousness. I quickly grabbed Rin's shoulder to stop her.

"Hey Rin, calm down for a moment."      
"Sensei, but..."      
"Your current actions won't help resolve the situation. I taught you to make calm judgments at all times."      
"...! Yes, I'm sorry..."

Rin lowered her eyes in reflection and released the doctor.      
The doctor coughed a little, sounding pained, but seemed alright.      
Rin is usually calm, but once she gets an idea in her head, she can take dangerous actions. I had tried to correct that when I instructed her before, and she had gotten much better, but... it seems she lost herself upon hearing the words "monster disaster."<!--more-->      

"I'm sorry, Doctor. Are you alright?"      
"Ah, no problem. It seems she has a deep connection with 'monster disasters,' doesn't she? I'll be careful."      
"Thank you for your concern. I'll stop her faster next time."

In her childhood, Rin lost both her parents and became an orphan due to monsters that emerged into the city during a monster disaster.      
Although she's better now, she used to have trouble sleeping because she would remember those times in her dreams. Since she started living with Amatsuki, such incidents have decreased, but it's impossible to completely forget.      
Even now, 'monster disasters' remain a deep trauma in Rin's heart.

"So, could you tell us in more detail? Why will a 'monster disaster' occur?"      
"A monster disaster is a bug that occurs when the magic energy circulating within a dungeon stops for some reason. When magic energy gets clogged, various problems occur in the dungeon, and the same goes for the monsters living inside. Because of this, monsters that normally wouldn't leave the dungeon end up going outside."

Dr. Nero spoke fluently.      
His explanation matched the most prominent hypothesis currently. I recall this hypothesis was developed by Mr. Maki after many years of research, so its credibility is quite high.      
The fact that he's saying the same thing means there's a high probability that what he's saying is correct.      

"And according to my analysis, the circulation of magic energy has stopped at the lowest level of this dungeon, and the environment has deteriorated. If this continues, the monsters will be affected and will come out."      
"...Does that mean we need to quickly go to the lowest level here and defeat the dungeon boss?"      
"Exactly. Don't worry, the boss is just a little further ahead. It shouldn't take much time to reach it."

It might be dangerous to trust the words of someone I just met, but I can't just ignore it after hearing that a monster disaster will occur.       
If that happens, many monsters will be released into the ocean. The impact would extend not only to Japan but also overseas. Dojima-san wouldn't have enough stomach acid to deal with it, no matter how much he had.       
And... for Rin's sake, who joined the Ministry of Monster Control to prevent monster disasters, I can't let it happen.

"Dojima-san."       
"Hmm, let's do that."      
"I haven't said anything yet?"      
"You're going to say we should go down and defeat the dungeon boss anyway, aren't you? There might be some complaints, but I'll permit it. Let's quickly destroy this dungeon and go home."      
"...Thank you."

Alright, now I can head down without worries. I'm grateful to Dojima-san.      
I went over to Rin, who still looked anxious.

"Don't worry, Rin. I won't let a monster disaster happen. Let's defeat the dungeon boss and go home."      
"...! Yes!"

Rin regained her composure and nodded reliably.      
Good, it seems she'll be alright.

"Dr. Nero, is that alright with you?"      
"Ah, it's fine. I'm interested in the outside world, but opportunities to observe a Dungeon Break up close don't come around often."

Dr. Nero's glasses glinted as he smiled.      
This person is the same type as Mr. Maki. He's the type who prioritizes research above all else.      
In any case, there's no time. Let's hurry to the lowest level.


◇　◇　◇


Having decided to go to the lowest level of the dungeon, we proceeded faster than ever before.       
Both Dojima-san and Rin possess top-tier abilities among explorers. Even though we were moving quite quickly, both of them kept up perfectly.      
However,

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

"Ugh, bluu-bluu-bluu..."      
"Hey! Don't vomit on my back!"

Dr. Nero, a normal otherworlder, couldn't withstand the speed and felt nauseous.      
Dojima-san was carrying him on his back, being the largest, but as a result, Dojima-san's back was stained with vomit. I felt bad for Dojima-san, but I was glad it wasn't me carrying him.

「Oh no lol」      
「Just watching makes me dizzy, so of course he'd throw up if he actually experienced it」      
「Just watching, I'm also... ugh」      
「Here's some motion sickness medicine」      
「Speaking of which, a monster disaster... I hate how many dangerous topics there are lately」      
「If Shachiken wasn't here, it would really be a global crisis」      
「The future of Earth rests on the corporate slave swordsman's back」      
「Well, it's the Minister's back that has vomit on it, though」      
「Smells bad (small impression)」

I sympathize with Dojima-san, but we need to hurry now.      
I cut down monsters that occasionally attacked us as I pushed deeper and deeper into the dungeon.

"The magic energy is getting quite dense. Have we entered the deep layers already? Are you feeling alright, Rin?"      
"Yes... I'm alright. Thank you for your concern."

Rin said so, but she looked a little unwell.      
When the surrounding magic energy suddenly becomes dense, magic energy poisoning is more likely to occur. Even experienced S-rank adventurers are said to descend cautiously, gradually acclimating their bodies when going from the lower to the deep layers.
Dojima-san and I are fine, but it must be a tough environment for the still young Rin.

「She looks like she's struggling, but will she be okay?」      
「It's numbed by Shachiken, but the deep layers aren't a place you can go to so casually」      
「That's true」      
「Just being able to go to the deep layers is enough to be recognized as a top-class explorer. If you compare them to Tanaka, it's impossible lol」      
「For Rin-chan's age, just being able to go to the lower layers makes her the cream of the crop. Going to the deep layers is an impossible level」  

Ideally, I'd want Rin to rest.      
However, it's dangerous to leave her alone in this dungeon, and above all, Rin herself wouldn't allow herself to rest. So, the best course of action is to take her along and protect her with all my might if anything dangerous happens.       
For now, we just have to proceed with the utmost caution.        
As I was thinking that, I sensed multiple magic energy reactions from ahead.

"Something's coming. Prepare yourselves."      
"Yes...!"

Rin and I put our hands on our weapons as we ran. Dojima-san, who was carrying Dr. Nero on his back, couldn't fight effectively, so he shouldn't be counted as a combatant.

『SHAAAAAAH!!』

What appeared with a high-pitched roar was a giant shark, about 10 meters long.      
And not just any shark. It was a shark that flew through the air by flapping its fins. Four flying sharks attacked us, baring their sharp fangs.

「Shark!?」      
「Why is a shark flying...?」      
「Huh? Sharks normally fly, don't they?」      
「Exactly. What are they talking about?」      
「'What are they talking about?' is what we should be saying」      
「It's even been in movies, so it's not weird for them to fly」(Tl: This is the most stupid rationalization I’ve ever seen)      

"Rin, can you match me?"         
"Yes. Of course."

Hearing Rin's strong words, I jumped towards the flying shark, 'Flying Shark'.      
The Flying Shark opened its mouth wide, trying to swallow me. I lured it in until the last possible moment.

"Hmph!"

And just before I was swallowed, I drew my sword and cut the Flying Shark in half.      
It looked scary, but aside from its flying ability, it was just a shark. It wasn't a very strong monster.

「Ah, even a shark couldn't defeat Shachiken, huh...?」      
「Well, it's an A-rank monster, after all lol」      
「That one is the weakest among the Four Heavenly Kings of Sharks」      
「To be defeated so easily, what a disgrace to the Four Heavenly Kings of Sharks...」       
「There are three more like that...?」      

Having defeated the Flying Shark, I prepared to land on the ground.      
However, seizing that opening, the other Flying Sharks charged at me with open mouths. I don't think I'd get injured even if a Flying Shark bit me, but I want to avoid getting covered in drool.      
I kicked the air and leaped, dodging its bite and getting behind it. Then I firmly grabbed its tail.

『SHAH!?』

"Hmph!"

And holding its tail, I swung it around.      
I swung it faster and faster, then threw it towards the other Flying Sharks.      
The Flying Shark flew with considerable momentum, collided with another Flying Shark, and was blown away with a loud sound, then stopped moving.

「Too reckless lol」      
「Oh no, oh no」      
「At least use your sword (crying)」      
「If Shachiken was in a shark movie, it would end in 5 minutes lol」      
「Rather, Tanaka might turn into a shark」      
「Will he become Shark-ken...?」      
「It would be hopeless to think of surviving」

Having dealt with three Flying Sharks, I looked at Rin.      
She was just about to deliver the finishing blow to another Flying Shark.

"Haaaaah!"

She thrust a blade wreathed in lightning into its crown.      
And then, she unleashed lightning from the blade, thoroughly cooking the Flying Shark's insides.      
Flying Sharks have fairly durable bodies, but after that, recovery is impossible.

"She doesn't struggle with A-rank monsters. As expected of Rin."      
"No, this is all thanks to Sensei's guidance."

I don't think I taught her much, but it makes me genuinely happy to hear that from my student.      
Well, we've overcome the obstacles, so shall we move on...? As I was thinking that,

"Wonderful! To think I'd meet such a talent in this place!"      
"Huh?"

Wondering what was happening, Dr. Nero approached me, looking excited.      
Didn't he throw up and pass out? He suddenly got energetic.
