Tl: Sam


…



'Overtime Mode' can only be activated when it's past closing time.          
Normally, I can only use about 20% of my strength, but in this state, I can wield my full power.

「Overtime Mode is here! With this, we win!」         
「Overtime is here━━━━(゜∀゜)━━━━!」         
「I can hear the victory BGM」        
「Oh, right, it's already past 6 PM lol」      
「We won, I'm going to the restroom」     
「No, even if he gets stronger, the situation hasn't changed, has it?」      
「Still, Shachiken should be able to do something」      
「If Tanaka doesn't do it, who will?」    

"Sensei? What on earth are you...?"       
"Rin, please rest for a bit. Oh, it might shake, so you'd better hold onto the ground tightly."        
"Eh, yes..."

Rin tilted her head but lowered her posture and gripped the ground.        
Confirming that, I readied my sword and looked up at the ceiling. Above us was a thick rock layer and the vast ocean. To survive, we needed to break through them and get to the surface.

「What is he really going to do?」       
「Can he use warp?」       
「He can use dimensional slash, so it's possible lol」      
「Isn't he just going to cut the ground normally?」<!--more-->       
「Then water would flow in and it'd be over, right?」       
「That's true」      
「...Are we still stuck after all?」      
「Let's believe in the Shachiken we believe in」

I held my sword in an overhead stance and concentrated.       
Then I adjusted my power release rate to about 70%.     
...Alright, this should be it. It's been a while since I've unleashed this much power. I need to be careful not to accidentally hurt Rin with too much momentum.         
With the utmost caution, I swung my sword above my head.

"Tanaka Style Swordsmanship True Form---Hoshigiri (Star Cutter)."

The moment the sword was swung, an invisible sword gleam was unleashed upwards.         
That critical strike instantly cut through the bedrock, and further, bisected the vast ocean above it.         

「Huh?」      
「Eh?」      
「Ehhhhhh!?」       
「What is this?」     
「Haaah?」     
「Hee!」

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

The bedrock and the sea were cleanly bisected. Beyond them, the sky stretched out.     
Phew, it's been a while since I did this, but it worked out well.     
Looking at Rin, she was dumbfounded, staring at the cleaved space above.  

"S-Sensei, that technique just now..."        
"Hmm? You mean Hoshigiri? Hoshigiri is a technique for 'anti-star use.' By imbuing the slash with repulsive force, it prevents what's cut from returning to its original state for a while. That part of the sea will probably remain cut for about 30 minutes."

「Imbuing a slash with repulsive force...?」        
「I see, I don't understand」       
「????」       
「The viewers' faces have turned into cosmic cats」        
「By the way, what's repulsive force?」       
「It's a force that repels objects... but I don't understand what it means to imbue a slash with it lol」       
「Laws of physics: "How many times do I have to break today?"」(Tl: I like the way this novel is literally calling itself out on how outlandish some of these feats are)          
「Laws of physics-kun's body is already in tatters」      
「Before that, what's an 'anti-star use' technique? Are you planning to fight stars?」       
「Don't think too deeply, just feel it」       
「If it's Shachiken, he really might be able to fight stars」      
「Even Rin-chan would surely be put off by this... no, she's probably fallen in love again」       
「She's a muscle head, so it can't be helped」      
「Hurry up and get married」        
「They're already engaged, you know」        
「Explode forever」

"Alright, then, shall we go home?"         
"Yes, let's go home to our house."

I carried Rin on my back and walked along the cut surface towards the surface.          
Partway through, the footing changed from bedrock to sea, but since the water was solidified by the repulsive force, we could walk normally.       
Rin, carried on my back, gazed at the cross-section of the sea.

"It's beautiful. It's like an aquarium."        
"You're right. Since we're here, shall we go to a real aquarium sometime?"        
"Y-yes! Absolutely!"       
"Hey, it's dangerous if you move."

As we exchanged such casual conversation, we safely escaped the dungeon and returned to the surface.
