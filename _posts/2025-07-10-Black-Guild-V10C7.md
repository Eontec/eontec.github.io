『Bluu-bluu..!!!!』

Perhaps not expecting its two mysterious cylinders to be stopped, the evil god made a confused sound as it violently clashed them together.      
Then, the cylinders made a juu! sound and glowed orange. The cylinders seemed to be emitting high heat due to some unknown technology, and the air near them shimmered.

「What is that!?」      
「A weapon?」      
「I've never heard of Cthulhu using weapons」     
「Well, there are often subtle differences between myths and monsters...」      
「Looks hot 」       
「He's got a brutal weapon」        
「But I feel like I've seen that weapon somewhere before...」      
「Me too. Deja vu, maybe?」

『Luuuaah!!』

The evil god swung the orange-glowing cylinders down at me.<!--more-->      
I kicked off the water's surface and leaped, dodging it, and the cylinders violently struck the water. As they looked, the cylinders seemed to be superheated, and when they hit the water, they made a juuuuuh!! sound, evaporating the water.

"Looks like it would be hot if it hit..."

「'Hot' is an understatement」        
「A normal human would melt away lol」       
「Well, Tanaka's stopped being human, so...」       
「For Shachiken, it might be like the heat of a stove」        
「By the way, that weapon is too insane. It's practically a weapon of mass destruction」         
「Seriously, what is that weapon?」

The evil god continued to swing the mysterious cylinders and attack.       
Its movements were monotonous, but its speed made it surprisingly difficult to approach. It seemed a bit hard to get close without getting hit. No choice, I'll go head-on.

『Lululu-ooh!!』

The evil god raised its two cylinders and swung them down at me simultaneously.      
I had been waiting for that blow.      
The moment the two cylinders were about to hit me, at the perfect timing, I swung my sword and deflected the cylinders.

"Tachibana Style Swordsmanship, Oumugaeshi (Parrot's Return)!"

With a pakiin! sound, the cylinders bounced back with incredible force.      
And the cylinders returned on their original trajectory, hitting the evil god's head.

『Gurur!?』

With a juu! sound, the cylinders scorched the evil god's head.      
Whoa, that looks painful. Glad it didn't hit me.

「He deflected it!?」      
「This is already a parry」(Tl:Sekiroo)        
「So parrying can be used outside of games too...?」        
「Shachiken, conversely, what can't you do?」        
「Looks incredibly painful」      
「Go, Shachiken!」

Kicking the water's surface, I approached the evil god, who was writhing in pain.       
Then, I gripped the hilt of the sword sheathed at my waist and swiftly drew it.

"Tanaka Style Swordsmanship, Matataki (Blink)."

A sword gleam flashed, and a high-speed Iai (drawing and cutting) was unleashed.      
That single blow delivered a diagonal cut to the evil god's torso, inflicting a deep wound.

『Lul, oh...!』

The evil god groaned in pain and collapsed on the spot. I thought it would sink, but it fell onto a floating island instead.

"Defeated... no, it's still breathing? What incredible regeneration."

The evil god seemed to still be alive, moving slightly. It looked like it would die if left alone, but I might as well approach and check on it.      
As I thought that and went to the floating island, Dojima-san and the others also arrived.

"You did it, Tanaka. Haven't you gotten stronger again?"       
"As expected, Sensei! Even an evil god is no match for you, Sensei is truly amazing...!"

Dojima-san and Rin praised me.      
I was happy, but I felt something strange. Its rank should be EX III, yet it felt a bit 'weak' for that.      
Compared to the Demon Lord I fought before, there seemed to be quite a difference. I couldn't believe it was the same rank as that one.      
Was the rank wrong... or was it exhausted for some reason...? Well, there's no way to know just by thinking about it, but it's bothering me.

"Wonderful! To defeat an evil god with a human body! Hmm, I really want to experiment... research. Could you let me make a small incision, just a little bit?"    

Dr. Nero, carried on Dojima-san's back, approached, panting.      
I felt a shiver. I might not be good with this person.

<div data-nat="424166"></div>

「The Doctor is unwavering lol」      
「This person started talking about experiments」      
「Well, I am curious about what's going on with Shachiken's body lol」     
「The time I reincarnated and the best experimental subject was right in front of me」     
「Is this a light novel?」      
「Even if he tried to make an incision, a normal scalpel wouldn't even scratch Tanaka's skin, you know?」      
「He'd need something Excalibur-class」      
「Making an incision with a holy sword is too surreal lol」

"Well, putting experiments aside... it's better to finish off the evil god quickly. Even in my world, these beings are anomalies. They are beings that can never be understood. Especially evil gods, they are malevolent beings that bring chaos to the world."

Dr. Nero spat out, looking at the evil god lying there in pain.      
It seems evil gods, Dagosuke, and the others are quite disliked in other worlds. Lilicia was also scared when she first saw Dagosuke and Riri.       
But I'm skeptical about that idea. They certainly look different, but isn't it possible to understand each other?

『Taso...』

I approached the evil god, who was muttering something.        
Then the evil god moved only its eyes and looked at me. It had scary eyes, but I sensed intelligence. Just as I was thinking it might be possible to communicate, my chest pocket began to squirm.

"Riri?"

Poking her head out of my pocket was Riri.        
She seemed to have been sleeping until now, and her eyes looked sleepy. Come to think of it, she didn't even come out during mealtime. She must have been sleeping soundly.

「Riri-chan!」      
「Riri-taso~~~」       
「Saved!」       
「Cute!」      
「Riri-taso is so cute, pant pant」      
「As expected, Riri-taso's popularity is amazing lol」       
「Riri-chan cures all illnesses」

Her popularity was still incredible. Riri's personal (?) channel subscribers finally surpassed 10 million.      
If I upload a meal video to social media, it goes viral in seconds, and lately, I've been secretly worried that her popularity might surpass mine.      
Even if my popularity drops, Riri's popularity doesn't seem to be declining, so there might be a future where she supports me.

『Luah...?』

When Riri appeared, the evil god's gaze turned to Riri.      
Come to think of it, Riri's species is Shoggoth. That's also a creature from the Cthulhu Mythos.      
I was wondering if it would show some kind of unusual reaction... when suddenly the evil god opened its mouth wide and,

『R-Riri-taso~~~~~!!』

It let out a voice so loud it felt like my eardrums would burst.       
...Huh? Did it just say "Riri-taso"? How did it know about Riri? And can it understand language?

What on earth is going on...?

Tl Note: Call Me for more future predictions. It wasn't a 100% accurate prediction, but I did call it pretty much exactly.
