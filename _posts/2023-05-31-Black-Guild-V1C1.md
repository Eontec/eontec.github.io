Marriage is the graveyard of life
There is such a word, but I think it is a little different.

"Employment is the graveyard of life..."

　I, Makoto Tanaka, a salaried worker, murmured to myself while looking at the email describing today's work.

　The quota written there was not an amount that could be finished within the specified time. Overtime confirmed today too... I let out a deep sigh.

"Five A-class Minotaurs and four Basilisks. On top of that, three S-class Tyrant Dragons, huh... I don't think we'll make it in time for the last train today."

　They are all troublesome monsters.

　Even if I were to dive into the dungeon from now on, 24 hours would have passed even if I was in a hurry.

　It was ten years ago that I took up the job of subjugating monsters... when I was 15 years old.

"It still feels like a dream."

　Ten years ago, mysterious structures called "dungeons" suddenly appeared all over the world. Unknown creatures and over-technology weapons were sleeping there.

　People became "explorers" and dived into the dungeons to find treasure.

　A special power dwells in the humans who enter the dungeon, making them dozens of times stronger than normal humans. Of course, it wasn't all of them, only the talented ones, and luckily or unluckily, I awoke to my power.

　It's a dungeon exploration that is side by side with death, but it seems that it's becoming popular to distribute that state on a video distribution site called D Tube.

　By the way, I've never done it. I don't even know how I can get money from it because I've been living with my work. It's times like these that I realize I'm getting old...

“Now then, shall we enter the dungeon immediately… and before that.”

　I take out a small spherical machine from my pocket and activate it.

　Then it floats softly near me.

　This is a small drone. It's an excellent product that takes a picture and automatically sends it to the company.

　Depending on the settings, it seems that it can be distributed on the video site as it is, but I only use this for reporting quotas to the company.

　I take out my smartphone and fiddle with the drone settings.

"Um, select a server for company distribution... Uh."

　Sudden lightheadedness and dizziness on the spot.

　Come to think of it, I only took a two-hour nap today.

　I haven't been home for two weeks. When was the last time I had a good night's sleep?

"What am I doing?"

　The company I work for is a government subcontractor.

　It's admirable if you ask that much, but it's just that you're being forced to do troublesome things that even the government doesn't want to do. There is always a lot of hard work piled up in our company.

　At this rate, I'll die from overwork... I know that, but I'm too busy to even think about quitting. I dive into the dungeon with a dead face as usual today.

"My vision is blurry... um, this is the setting... it should be fine."

　After setting up the drone, I stepped into the dungeon with a sword on my waist.

　This time, we dive into one of the largest dungeons in Tokyo, "Shibuya Underground Dungeon". It is the largest dungeon in Japan, and the deep part of it is today's site.

“――――From now on, we will start our business.”



　I tighten my tie and dive into the dungeon.

　At this time, I had no idea.

　Because of this dungeon dive today, my life will change greatly――――

"Hmm? What is this delivery?"

"It's titled ‘For Company Records’, but maybe you've set it up wrong?"

"He didn't realize he was streaming. It seems he didn't even read the comments."

"I mean, this is Shibuya Dungeon, isn't it? He’s diving deep alone, but is it okay?"

"This is a suicide stream."

"You’ll die quickly if you go to large dungeons without at least three people."

"Hey, 3 people in the same room is too small lol"

"Well, this channel doesn't usually stream."

"This is the Black Dog Guild channel, right? Is the office worker in this suit a member of the guild? "

"He's not on the guild member list on the official website."

"Hey, there's today's quota in the summary column, but it's not the amount you can do by yourself lol."

"It's true lol I think it's a typo, but if it's serious the black dog guild is too black lol"

"It's not just black, it's very bad lol"

"Looks interesting. I'll let the people on the bulletin board know."

"I think I've seen this person before. Where did you see him?"

TL Note: I just started with this novel, It’s my first project. I’m somewhat occupied with school a lot of the time, so updates might not be regular, but I’ll definitely be as consistent as possible.
